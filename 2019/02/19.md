nical
  * Monday
    * rebased the tiling origin patch again put it up for review
    * pushed wr 0.60 on crates.io
    * trying to compare "smoothness" of the playback between wr and chrome
      * I find that on some videos, slow travelings look a bit "stuttery" even though the reported framerate is stable
      * I "felt" a lot of the stuttering while watching Roma on netflix, I found another video with slow traveling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiV3J_e977Q
      * it kinda looks bad on chrome as well, not sure
  * Tuesday
    * booked flights and airbnb
    * still trying to get unwinding to work with perf in gecko
      * it works with other porgrams, just not gecko. Tried various mozconfig tweaks, 3 different computers
      * got it to work with perf compiled from sources
      * unfortunately the call stacks aren't great still (we know we have a lot of page faults on the render backend and scenen builder thread on the test case I'm looking at but not where they are
    * looking at how we do masks in blob images

aosmond
  * bug 1527951 (WebP misleading alpha)
    * if the image header said there was no alpha, we would use BGRX but might still be given non-opaque alpha bits
    * this could trip asserts with skia, or with WR, cause us to see what is beneath the window on Linux (!!)
    * put up for review / landed a fix and test cases for this
  * bug 1520656 (image rows shifted by 3 pixels when pasted from clipboard)
    * landed fix
  * bug 1526756 (twitter bad text)
    * reduced Jeff's reduced test case even more
    * investigation continues, but I no longer believe this is a text snapping issue

jrmuizel
  * reduced twitter bad text test case
    * wrote some tools to help test case reduction
  * looked into improve WebRender serialization/deserialization: https://github.com/jrmuizel/webrender/tree/bincode-max

  * Wrote a fix for bug 1526958 (Optimize mozilla::dom::TouchEvent::PrefEnabled)
  * Currently looking into shrinking nsDisplayTransform (bug 1526941), the tricky part here is the weird dance we do to calculate bounds of 3D transformed items
