  * bug 1520760 (no AVX2 support libjpeg crash) -- think I finally got to the bottom of this now, wrote patch just need to verify on right hardware
  * bug 1526756 (twitter text blurry) -- on the right track, put together a patch which nominally fixes the blurry text, but I need to trace through the clip mask code to better understand what is going on before committing (it is possible this is a two wrongs make a right sort of patch :)); in essence I believe we need to snap differently when we are using an intermediate surface for clipping purposes
  * more triaging after lee's change moved bugs around buckets

miko
  * Talked about DL performance work with Matt.
    * Came up with a couple of new ideas, the most promising being nsDisplayWrapList optimization, bug 1529698
    * Talked about the schedule and the scope of current work, we estimate that fixing the currently open bugs will result in 10-25% performance improvement during DL building
  * Continued work with nsDisplayTransform change
    * All tests pass

nical
