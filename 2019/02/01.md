  * reviewing the deSlackification document

kats
  * looked into the various regressions from my filter/clip patch, and backed out the patch
  * made reduced test cases and landed them as reftests (bug 1524353, bug 1524261)
  * discussed improving the isolation behaviour in WR so we can do The Right Fix of setting a clip chain on the stacking context, which seems to fix all the things (with picture caching disabled). tracking this in bug 1524385
  * wrote a logging patch for bug 1511901 - somebody is having trackpad scrolling issues
  * remaining WPT jobs on windows seem stable now so I wrote patches to update annotations and turn them on - bug 1524580

  * will miss the daily
  * I think that the blur issue is caused by a bad interaction between:
    * how downscaling doesn't always sample exactly between pixels, and the blending not being in linear space means birghtness differences depending on the size of the blurred source
    * how we clip against the display port before blurring, which causes the size of the blurred source to change each frame
    * the test case has several blurs stacked which amplifies the error.
  * If I'm right then:
    * down-scaling in linear space would fix the issue
    * fixing up the size of the source so that it is always a multiple of the most down-scaled task (to ensure that we sample exactly between pixels at each step) would fix the issue
    * not clipping the text against the display port before blurring would fix the issue and would also be more correct (but would be a problem for very large partially visible blurred things).

botond
  * APZ/Fission meeting with Henri and Ryan 
  * investigating some incoming bugs: bug 1523514, bug 1523844 
  * reviews: bug 1520077 (follow up work for "content out of reach" bug), bug 1451461 (mentored bug) 
  * continued investigating bug 1523329; it's a layout bug, regression from bug 1512244 
  * bug 1519621 (regression from bug 1498812 related to frame reconstruction): have WIP patch 
  * containerless scrolling 
    * helped draft PI request 
    * address review comments on bug 1522714 
    * got Android marionette test to run locally, still need to debug it

jbonisteel
  * Mostly 1:1s and meetings yesterday 
  * Responding to a few emails about android stuff
  * 

miko
  * Filed bug 1524573 for macOS input type="range" rendering problem
  * Hacking on marionette simulator script so I can run it for Alexa top n sites and find the ones with slowest display list builds

aosmond
  * bug 1453935 (gradient snapping) -- hopefully finally solved this, just waiting on the try results about any necessary fuzz

jnicol
  * overlapping border corners patch landed \o/
    * (if you see bugs with borders cc me)
  * webrender on android - working on fix for gradient bug

jrmuizel
  * more triage
  * looked at gradients snapping with andrew
  * some blob recoord refactoring
  * landed intel on by default
  * webgl
