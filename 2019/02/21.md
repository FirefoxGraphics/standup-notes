  * nsDisplayTransform shrinking
    * Quick PoC seemed to give around 6% performance improvement in DL inactive mutate test, which uses a lot of transforms
    * Since this hack did not properly implement nsDisplayTransform::ComputeVisibility, other tests were regressing due to buggy clipping/occlusion culling
    * I believe I have the main problems figured out
