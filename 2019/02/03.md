  * blurring bug investigation
    * I had managed to convince myself that doing interpolation in srgb was the issue
    * went trhough parts of the CSS spec to find what exactly we are required to do in srgb
    * I finally managed to decide that isn't actually a color space problem
    * it's just that downsampling the way we do is only correct if the destination image is exactly half the size of the source
      * so if we want to down-sample twice we need to first ensure that the source size is a multiple of 4.
