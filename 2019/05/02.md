	* Quite a few meetings and 1:1s yesterday
	* GFX Fission sync, notes here if anyone wants to take a look: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LrrD0kiVWAvog1Q6ivVh5GhSkhP11WvS8VMO_5ehIR4/edit#
	* I am off tomorrow! 

rhunt
	* fission meeting
	* continued prototyping applying graphical effects (clipping, scaling, visibility) to OOP-iframes
		* have information gathered, retained, and communicated correctly
		* have visibility applied correctly
		* looking at applying clipping and scaling
		* need to write a WR code path as well

kats:
	* started trying to cross-compile osmesa for android, so we can run headless wrench reftests
	* meeting about fission stuff
	* started working on bug 1524232 which is slightly less trivial than I thought but still not bad
		* filed bug 1548560 for a pre-existing issue I ran into
	* turned on debug wrench reftests in CI (linux only). looks like rawtests also have a panic in debug mode


miko
	* Reviews 
	* Looked into bug Bug 1535276 (Sluggish zoom in https://www.alpacaprojects.com/inferno/en/) 
		* Slow display list builds due to visible scroll bars 
		* Creating WR blobs seems slow 
	* Looked into bug Bug 1547420 (Assertion failure in FLB) 
		* Possibly caused by an overflow when calculating paint rect intersection. 
		* Compiling an Android build to find out more 
	* Investigating an alternative solution to implement light-weight display items: 
		* Rather than introducing a new base class, introduce a new derived class that contains the current “god display item” functions for painting

jrmuizel
	* roughly figured out what was going on with svg filter image blob bug
		* have a patch that fixes
		* trying to make a test
			* failed so far
