  * Some 1:1s yesterday
  * Talking to astevenson (recently became a PM helping Andreas)
  * HR stuff
  * H1 Performance reviews coming soon: we will need to do self assessments on our goals in early June so you can expect me to talk about that more over the next few weeks
  * Meeting with overholt, I need to care about SR&ED (CDN tax credit program)

nical
  * will miss the daily
  * fighting mercurial
  * rebasing patches
  * blob reco stuff

miko
  * Participated in mandatory office safety training
  * Wrote a patch to not build unnecessary items for hit testing or plugins, inside opacity: 0 containers
  * Working on refactoring the new container item (bug 1529698)
    * Clipchain / ASR invariants are confusing and need special handling
    * This container item should not need to support clipping, since it is not visible to painting code, and clips should be properly set in children
      * Sadly some callers expect all the items to have clipchains set, for example GetClipWithRespectToASR()

jnicol
  * landed border clipping fix (1550582)
    * not sure if we want to uplift?
  * re-working glyph zooming patch

rhunt
  * fought through remaining test failures for fission tab switching patches
    * nsWindowRoot code for tracking remote tabs is broken and I've given up thinking it was my fault, fixed it
    * lifetime of new browser actor is different from IPDL, need to catch this and cache some values
    * SessionStore code uses nsIRemoteTab as if it corresponds to BrowserParent, had to update the code to instead use content process IDs
    * fixed the cycle collection annotations for new actor
    * rebased patches
  * briefly looked at cbindgen's error handling for name collisions
