miko
  * Fixed a review nit for display item merging patch (bug 1549860) and landed it 
  * Looked into removing mReferenceFrame from nsDisplayItem (bug 1542929) 
    * Does not seem too difficult but there are easier fields to get rid of first 
  * Today Iâ€™ll work on moving display item data specific things to nsPaintedDisplayItem, this should free up 16 bytes and allow creating a 256 byte container item (down from 512)
