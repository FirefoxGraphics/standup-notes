botond
  * Pathfinder presentation 
  * reviews: bug 1213601 (got it landed!), bug 1549504, bug 1496609, bug 1550467
  * interview prep
  * desktop zooming 
    * bug 1523405 (scrollbar rendering): continuing to investigate reftests; made some realizations: 
      * (1) we don't want to mix meta viewport support with layout scrollbars (unnecessary complexity) 
        * but we use initial-scale to set a main-thread resolution in existing reftests; may want a reftest-resolution attribute instead 
      * (2) scrollthumb sizing works differently on desktop (there's a minimum length)
