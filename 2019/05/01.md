  * WOAH IT IS MAY WE ARE SHIPPING WEBRENDER MVP SOON \0/ \0/ 
  * Wrote a draft post about our roll out plans: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PXBuTrO13dZrC6yXoUkmJkCM7JMEfVqUwPc4gsd-IQ/edit#
    * Very much welcome feedback
  * Triage 
    * NagBot strikes  
  * Put together a doc to wrangle some estimates for Android: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HJDYRPpyKWdzmkrrWREN71pIGrW5KSotVodQWZ8xBKE/edit#gid=1546127548
    * estimates for enabling in Nightly, not yet for riding the trains
  * Some chatter around having WR on an HD8 for a demo at all hands
    * tl;dr - we aren't yet prioritizing the work specific to that device yet, everyone agrees that is okay. If it happens to work well enough for a demo - coolio - but no specific effort for that needed
  * Also spent time on WR roadmap, moving a few things to 'Done' that have been completed https://github.com/orgs/FirefoxGraphics/projects/1
