  * more WR review
  * WebGPU discussions about out-of-bounds access

jbonisteel
  * Bit of triage
  * 1:1s
  * Setting up experiment and roll-out request for 68 target
  * Coordinating some more All Hands meetings
  * Asked again about Android telemetry, no satisfying answers yet will probably hunt people down at All Hands at this point

jnicol
  * review changes for shader cache
  * put advanced blend fix up for review (but disabled it on adrenos to workaround driver bug, so it won't be tested on try...)
  * will look in to black squares on webrender on a Mali device (1558374)

gankro
  * cbindgen docs done https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/blob/master/docs.md
  * looking back into this windows maximization issue

kats:
  * turned on gecko reftests (WR disabled) on android emulator/geckoview - bug 1501582
  * landed some cleanup for enabling/disabling WR in automation - bug 1558598
  * wrote patches for async zoom + WR - bug 1557970
  * started looking at document splitting stuff  - bug 1548247

nical
  * implemented a fast image shader and the plumbing to decide when to use it.

botond
  * reviews: bug 1551801 
  * bug 1557424 (second IRCCloud scrolling regression): got it uplifted to beta 
  * desktop zooming 
    * bug 1554790 (reftest-resolution): diagnosed Windows-only reftest failure (it was related to advanced layers) 
      * fixed it, relanded patches, also relanded bug 1554813 which was blocked on this 
        * with this, scrollbar rendering is now in good enough shape for an MVP 
      * aside, made layers logging prefs more consistent in bug 1558276 
    * bug 1556556 (scrollbar dragging when not zoomed in or out): investigating fix approach 
      * it's looking like the fix will be entangled with bug 1557160 (context menu mispositioned)
