  * Friday:
    * A handful of meetings, following up on some sec bugs, talking to Jeff before his leave
  * Goals this week:
  Keep an eye on WR bugs 
    This bug is concerning me a bit, seems to not be terribly reproducable so far: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1556106
      If others can try reproducing it too - that would be swell
  Self-assessment 
  * Heads up:
    * I have to take a half-day PTO on Thursday afternoon
    * Technically supposed to be at a conference on Friday, but might change my mind depending on how the week goes
