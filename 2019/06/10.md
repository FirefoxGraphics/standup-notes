nical
  * looked at the performance of a page killed by overdraw and large images
    * idea 1: have a fast image shader (easy) when a bacth doesn't need all of the fancy fatures like repetition
    * idea 2: classify blocks of NxN pixels (fully opauqe / fully transparent, semi transparent) for large images to reduce overdraw
  * looked at an OOM crash when pushing into the picture array (picture prim struct is 1272 bytes large)
  * looked at a UAF shutdown crash
    * implicit dependency between webrender threads and xpcom threads means we either have to shut webrender down synchronously or not create nsThread wrappers when registering threads with the profiler
  * wrote a tiler using a different algorithm from pathfinder's, haven't gotten to a point where I can measure/compare perf yet
