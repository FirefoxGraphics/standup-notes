    reviews: bug 1560237 

    got a loaner with a touchscreen from jlin, set it up 

    turns out the issue I was chasing has been fixed by bug 1554790 

    discussion with mconley related to picture-in-picture mode (mechanism for compositor to keep the main thread updated with the mouse position) 

    bug 1556556 (hit testing for desktop zooming) 

    posted patches that add a test (which is failing for now) + infrastructure for it in bug 1561726 so we can land them instead of them bitrotting 

    continuing to hack away at the fix; after rebasing, encountered some weird changes in test harness behaviour?
