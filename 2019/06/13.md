kats:
  * looked at document splitting stuff (bug 1548247) - assigned bug back to doug since he has working patches already. the issue he wanted me to look at seems unrelated, asked him to file a new bug for that
  * looked into making APZ mochitests compatible with macOS 10.14+ because a-team is migrating the macOS workers imminently, bug 1549052 has my patch
  * some searchfox reviews/investigation of recent breakages wrt scrolling to line numbers and such
  * fuzzed additional geckoview/emulator intermittents

nical
  * fixed reftest failures with my fast image shader patch
