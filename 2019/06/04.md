    * Rave party
      * Can't reproduce right now
    * Windows overflow bug
  * Discussing Android telemtry with Maire and David

    * Also talking about future experiment to measure wr vs non-wr for Android
  * Did my self-assesment in workday! 

rhunt (readonly, at coffee shop)
  * reviewed jrmuizel's CreateClippedDrawTarget patches, wrote up initial notes
  * posted the clean-up patches I mentioned yesterday for review
    * added a patch that removes unneeded BrowserChildBase
  * my trackpad on my MBP started failing so I scheduled a genius bar appointment to look at it
    * hung out at a coffee shop before hand
    * spilt coffee on my keyboard...
    * only option was then to get most of the internals replaced
    * working with IT to return this and get a loaner

    * this is caused by a 'fun' interaction of IPDL lifetime semantics
    * ni? nika for some answers

miko
  * Parent process RDL is enabled
    * A likely cause for possible chrome issues if they come up nowish
  * Finished patches to show more diagnostics information on RDL (bug 1490404)

kats:
  * dug a bit more on the android telemetry situation, looks like if we want to be able to compare WR on vs off code/data plumbing will need to be added somewhere by somebody
  * investigated a couple of bugs (window maximization, and bug 1548013) but wasn't able to repro
  * helped botond repro bug 1553045 and investigate
  * made some progress with gecko reftests on android+webrender

nical
  * wrote a "fix for the fix" for the canvas arc bug with skia, unfortunately lots of code to repeat with other backends
    * reorganizing things a bit to make it work with capture and recording backends
  * did the workday thing
