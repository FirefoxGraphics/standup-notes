  * snapping finally made it into the tree on Saturday \o/
  * scoping non-imagelib work for RGBA support
    * putting together a list of areas that consume/produce surfaces (e.g. webgl, canvas, blob, vector, printing, skia, cairo) and what needs to change for arch review
    * there would be less risk of everything going wrong if we taught all the areas to speak RGBA in addition to BGRA, instead of special pathing images for WebRender
    * goal: finish arch review, continue implementation work

kris (will miss standup)
