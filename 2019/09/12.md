  * Landed texture rect reftest
  * Added rasterized blob pixels to profiler (reviewed but not yet landed)
  * Started looking into how to profile and analyze webrender issues (using wizard of oz issue)
    * Took some etl traces, tried embedded profiler, VS profiler, ... 
    * Can't seem to find any evidence of the big spikes in the profilers strangely enough while it's visible on webrender profiler
    * Figuring out how blob rasterizing works end to end (and why/when blobs are used)
    * I'll look at some profiling presentations today, might want to pair up with someone to walk me through a profiling session
