aosmond
  * relanding snapping, take 3 -- just more reftest refinements
  * working on RGBA output patches
    * my original patch set was more ambitious, trying to reduce how many pixels we premultiply
    * for now, I'm changing it to not do that, but moving premultiplication/swizzling to the front of the pipeline, so that it is easier to land
    * once this is working, I can add plumbing to change what format we need in
