jnicol
  * more digging in to fenix+webrender blank tab switching
  * is indeed caused by us covering the android widget in white until we receive first paint message
  * the first paint message gets sent to the root WebRenderBridgeParent. But sometimes only the non-root WRBP receives a new display list, and the root one does not. so the root one is unable to tell android to uncover the widget.
  * not sure why the root one isn't getting a new display list, or maybe it's not supposed to and we should be sending the first paint message elsewhere

botond
  * interview prep 
  * APZ triage

  * bug 1576524 (WebExt regression caused by Fission change): verified, requested 70 uplift 
    * filed bug 1579896 as a follow-up for adding full support for APZ --> non-APZ tab moves 
  * interview, wrote up evaluation 
  * reviews: bug 1561227 (first pass) 
  * bug 1556556 (hit testing for desktop zooming): small amount of progress

miko
  * The failing static_assert with ANGLE is caused by clang using MSVC STL, which has a ifdef for â€œtransition period workaround", it can almost certainly be safely removed.
    * TLDR: <atomic> has had recent problems with MSVC, clang, and LLVM
  * Synced up with jgilbert who was available to look into ANGLE update talos regressions 
  * Investigated Android crash (bug 1574303) 
    * Had to debug another crash that was caused by a patch that landed yesterday (bug 1566386), backed it out locally 
    * Managed to reproduce the original crash I was investigating 
    * I now have a useless stack trace since Android debugging symbols are not working :(
