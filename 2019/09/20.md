  * Cleaned up transaction logging and pushed to try (waiting for try to submit review)
  * Spent most of the day getting android on windows going, but succeeded running!!
    * VM was no go (VirtualBox kept crashing)
    * switched to Windows insiders fast ring for WSL2
    * Ran into memory bug where WSL2 started using 32GB of memory (fix was to limit to 10G through wsl config file)
    * Managed to compile android
    * Ran into issues where I couldn't run on device, but some adb trickery allowed me to run from WSL2 on Pixel 3 device.
  * No progress on pix/nsight for FF.
    * Tried other way through debugger, seems to work, but can't get firefox to use nVidia card... forcing through control panel doesn't work.
    * Might look on Friday if I can force it in device init/enumeration.

jbonisteel
  * Getting caught up after being mainly out for three days
  * Attended performance cross functional meeting
  * Edits to the 'wr android wins' doc
  * Did an interview for the layout team
  * Team communication PSA:
    * I sent out an email with links to the various GFX channels in the potential IRC replacement apps
    * For sure, test out the various apps, chat with whomever you like in the various channels but IRC and Slack are still our "official" homes while this test period is happening
      * Don't just assume everyone is going to read every message in the various apps


aosmond
  * realized I needed to do premultiplication after color management instead of before with my RGBA swizzle perf improvements
    * this will be a better change though, as it will premultiply fewer pixels (as color management happens after downscaling)
  * got a better handle on the snapping regression on Humble bumble, putting together a fix now

nical
  * experimenting with gradient clips in webrender

jnicol
  * requested a data review for a single telemetry metric. plan is to get that landed first, check it works, then do the rest
  * some triage
  * some investigating getting wrench to build with ndk20

jrmuizel
  * blob regressions and improvements

botond
  * APZ triage 
  * bug 1564195 (touch event listener API for GV dynamic toolbar): have patches for this up for review 
  * bug 1545496 (GV de-XUL-ing): looked into an APZ assertion failure Brian ran into, have a fix for it 
  * bug 1581121 (crash regression): took a brief look but the stack traces are nonsensical and there is no STR; connection to APZ is tentative
