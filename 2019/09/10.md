  * some more issues with glean telemetry
  * investigating 1580153 - blank screen when switching tabs in fenix+webrender
    * doesn't reproduce in GVE but does in fenix.
    * I think we're rendering correctly, but the "first paint" message gets lost, and geckoview does this thing where it covers the app in white until it receives a first paint message
    * trying to build fenix with local geckoview now to test, but keep hitting problems

  * Look into webrender profiler and add rasterized blob pixel count
  * Look at why texturerect gl extension is not supported on CI with angle (software rasterizer?)

  * Wrote interview feedback 
  * Investigated DevTools blank lines when type attribute is changed (bug 1571644)
    * Found multiple possible causes, seems very difficult to narrow it down without a standalone testcase
  * Installed Visual Studio 2019 and reproduced the build failure due to ANGLE update (bug 1579743)
    * Currently trying to understand why the assertion was there in the first place
    * ( https://github.com/google/angle/blame/3255f493db0dc6f10bfb4c469ae0966d1afc9060/src/libGLESv2/global_state.cpp#L39 )
