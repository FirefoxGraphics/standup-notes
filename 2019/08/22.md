kris
  * Reading up a bit about WSL and how I can use it better in my workflow
  * Trying to move the visited-link tests to the reftest harness
    * First tried to adjust the code so I could add a "linksresolved" callback, but noticed a SpecialPowers accessor for an observer
    * Added SpecialPowers support in the reftest harness (should I?)
    * Test is running in reftests, but can't get the link to be 'visited' (works in normal browser session, are reftests running without history?)
  * Brushing up my javascript a bit in the meanwhile

miko
  * The latest ANGLE update broke clang and mingw builds
    * Clang builds are broken because of -fvisibility=hidden mismatch
    * mingw builds are broken by case-sensitive includes

nical
  * tryng to understand the remaining failing reftest with blob recoordination
  * trying to figure out how to make a 32bit build on win 64.
