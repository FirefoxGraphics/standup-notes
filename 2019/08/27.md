  * I got stuck with history suddenly not working anymore, it took me a while to realize it had nothing to do with my code changes and that my default profile caused it to no longer work (not sure why...)
  Deleting the obj dir profile got it working again... (??) It seems like it was launching in private mode
  * Edge case caused some failures where a function was unregistering itself from the observer list, causing it not to receive the visited status anymore.
  * 51 tests passing, 3 failing
  * Trying to understand the caret test and svg test failures.
  * Even with a callback, tests will still sometimes fail due to timing :/
  * Playing around with wrench profiler
Today:
  * Look into user prefs and overrides with reftests to see why the reftests softlock when history is temporarily enabled for certain reftests
  * Fix the caret and svg test
  * See if there is a proper event to wait for after links have been resolved (repaint or so? although I thought the reftests already did that)
  * Hopefully starting to look into webrender tasks.
  * Maybe sync up with Jeff to do a quick check of the reftest work. (if he has time)
