Jbonisteel:
  * Friday:
    * Had two interviews for our open req
    * Did a bit of triaging
    * Conversation with svoisen
    * Did my own H2 goals (once my manager approves I will add to shared team doc)
  * Goals for the week:
    * Make sure Kris has a good week in Toronto!
    * Review/approve team's H2 goals

kvark
  * WR plane splitting issue on Egencia - https://github.com/servo/plane-split/pull/33
  * landing, updating Gecko, and pushing Glenn's patch that depends on that
  * WR Swizzle blacklisting (rewrite) - https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D41274

jnicol
  * wrote reduced test case for adreno 3xx bug
    * exact problem is: PBO uploads with a stride which is a multiple of 128 bytes always write to 0th layer of texture array
    * which explains why we didn't hit the problem before we switched to arrays, or for GPU cache updates.
  * goals for week: enter H2 goals, then holiday \o/

nical
  * 1 reftest away from having the blob patches green on try

miko
  * WR DL deltas
    * Found the source of my problems, the information about display list build type (partial/full) was not propagated properly due to how display list iteration works:
      * The storage for cached display items needs to somehow be implemented per pipeline, currently this is done with hashmap of hashmaps, but maybe there is a better way
  * Goals for the week
    * Cleanup the patches, upload them and document the approach
    * Figure out H2 goals

jrmuizel
