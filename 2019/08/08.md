nical
  * blob stuff: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&author=nsilva%40mozilla.com&selectedJob=260359570
    * try push encouraging, most failures are fuzzable, a couple of unexpected passes and -WError stuff
    * remaining failures look related to tiling very large blobs, investigating
  * managed to reduce bug down to a very minimal test case, submitted a fix for review.

  * still looking in to the adreno3xx bug. think there's a few things at play here
    * blitting to the framebuffer doesn't work, so texture cache looks broken in the debug view
      * this makes it look like the adreno 4xx+ bug, but actually blitting between textures works fine on 3xx
    * PBO uploads don't always seem to work correctly, not sure why yet.
    * and I think there's another reason for garbage being drawn but I'm not sure what that is yet either.
