Friday
  * Got visited tests working in reftest with proper callback mechanism instead of hardcoded wait
  * Had to add callbacks for non visited flags as well (because the tests also rely on links explicitely marked as non-visited)
  * Changed all the reftest-visited tests to include the new logic
  * Added timeout so callback fail doesn't cause test stall.
  * got 26/54 test passing
Today
  * <Link href=''> seems to behave different than <a href> or test is correctly failing?
  * move around some svg tests that need visited logic
  * address softlock(?) when enabling history only for specific tests instead of harness
  * Remove mochitest implementation of visited-reftests
  * Start digging into wrench reftests (Dzmitry gave me a good overview on Friday)

  * Worked on 2020 headcount doc that product has put together
  * Sort of took half day PTO
  * Goals this week:
    * Finish headcount doc
    * Finally have consensus that Focus can use GV Nightly, push that along so we can enable WR
    * Finish updating the WR roadmap
    * Q4 planning - will want to do that around mid/later September, put together a plan to do that 'remotely'
