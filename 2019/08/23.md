Yesterday:
  * More computer issues with Dell dock and keyboard getting stuck every minute (Seems fixed after various BIOS setting changes)
  * Figured out reftests have history disabled, which explains why the visited test was not working
    * specifying default-preferences override in reftest.list seems to cause application to softlock (can't see anything obvious in the threads, everything is waiting...)
    * reftests sometimes seem to hang on my machine (normal?)
  * Debugging reftests so I can debug SpecialPowers api
    * couldn't find any way to enable SpecialPowers in normal context (pointing to reftest generated profile + environment variables didn't work) 
      * Found there is a way through the debugging tab, but highly discouraged due to security.
    * Unblocked: Kris Maglione helped me to figure out the issue. There was an extra register call needed that is unique to the JS wrapper.
    * Still seem to have issues with the test getting stuck
Today:
  * Continue with figuring out the messaging between JS and C++, seems like callbacks don't arrive (probably process related)
    * Setup a mochitest to see if it's easier to debug that way. (would allow me to reload tab)
  * webrender intro tasks
    * Mainly setting up workflow and seeing how reftests work in wrench
    * Getting a rust workflow going
