jbonisteel:
  * Couple of 1:1s
  * Onboarding Kris!
  * Added my goals to our team shared doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10s3243kIzyrT_uLIxzfhJXcmhZYUl7JtN5XGXH6mLis/edit#gid=1192400485 
  * Bit of triage, trying to see if anyone can repro: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567918, getting a reduced test case for: 1562091
  * Starting to think about 2020 planning - product will be getting going on that this month \0/
    * started a very rough list: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNHDu-fKhDKw7sLNSrkIQNMnIKv9U16x9kE4795ZrPQ/edit
      * emphasis on rough, will be discussing with everyone in 1:1s in the coming weeks
      * my goal is that we go to Jan All Hands with our Q1 plan already done
  * APAC/PST sync - notes below

jnicol
  * wrote a couple more reduced driver bug test cases
  * profiling moto g4 play
    * texture upload is taking lots of time (expected because of this PBO upload bug, hopefully the workaround I have in mind will help a lot)
    * some time linking shaders - shader cache improvements could help
    * lots of time in glViewport/SwapBuffers. need to do some GPU profiling to see what's killing us there.

miko
  * Investigated rust-lldb bug, it seems that rust-lldb crashes whenever there is a hashmap or hashset in the scope
    * This happened with different clang versions
  * Working on fixing a problem with display lists getting processed multiple times in a row
    * This is bad, since the items marked to be cached will be stored multiple times, and having a three-level nested hashmap is sadness

nical
  * will miss the daily
  * investigating blob stuff (jeff's patches and my remaining test failure)
  * trying to reproduce some windows bugs

Kris
  * Various Onboarding tasks
  * Looking at createPattern bug and figuring out how tests work
  * Pairing up with Jeff

jrmuizel
  * onboarded Kris
  * investigating the best way to run on WARP on CI

mstange
  * reviewed backdrop-filter https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1178765 
  * cleaned up MacIOSurface.cpp
