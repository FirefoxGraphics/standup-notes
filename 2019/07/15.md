miko
  * Feeling under the weather, I think I got food poisoning
  * It seems that the changes Dan made to WR DL serialization were more involved than I expected
    * The serialization format was completely changed, and my previous approach was relying on the previous format
  * Goal for the week:
    * Figure out how to actually ship something: currently leaning towards storing the deserialized items instead
      * the downside of this is that display item flattening needs to be refactored quite a bit, and it's more difficult to move item interning to api boundary

kvark
  * VkPI call
  * WR swizzle
  * WebGPU document
