  * Looked into slow motion mark display list builds (bug 1566826) 
    * We create thousands of empty opacity:0 items with hit test info 
    * Tried to figure out alternative approaches to improve hit test info implementation 
  * Looked into display list merging assertion (bug 1567916) 
    * Seems like a one time crash, and there has not been recent changes in the code 
    * Filed a follow-up bug to improve merging assertion output (bug 1567916)
  * Spotted some low-hanging fruit in DL building (do not sort display lists with less than two items)
    * In the worst case, we allocate stack space for 20 display items and dereference the frame to look up z-index, even if we only have one item in the list
