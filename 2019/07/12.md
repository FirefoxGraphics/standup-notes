miko
  * Tried and failed to reproduce sidebar add-on z-index regression (bug 1553007) 
  * Rebased my WR DL patches to include Danâ€™s bincode changes
    * This should let us have nicer WR DL items that actually include the "trailing slice data"
    * Still figuring out how to share mutable data with sub iterators

kats:
  * mostly writing taskcluster documentation. some procrastination too.
  * discovered that somehow now the WR fission subtests pass without WR as well (except on Win7) so made those run in bug 1560312

jrmuizel
  * discovered that I caused a common crash on Nightly
  * Got the wrong patch backed out of Nightly and a Nightly spun
  * Got the right patch backed out but it turns out the original patch that was backed out was causing android qr reftest failures
  * Tried reproducing the crash in rr, but rr was causing badness. Using an old version of rr worked better :(
  * Have theories for why both patches were wrong
  * Ran webrender benchmark on llvmpipe/swiftshader without batching swiftshader is still slow
