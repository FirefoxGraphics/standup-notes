  * Found some difficulties with improving display list merging assertions
    * Since merging will mutate both the original and new list, there is probably no fast way to store it beforehand, in case merging encounters an error
  * Wrote a patch to avoid sorting display lists with < 2 items
    * Also found a way to avoid creating temporary items and improve z-index lookups during sorting of positioned descendants
    * The idea is to use temporary display list merging storage in display items as a union and store z-index when the frame is in cache
    * After benchmarking and observing the list sizes for popular websites, this added complexity might not be worth it, since RDL seems to be good at reducing these worse cases with hundreds of items to sort
  * Looked through Connor's WIP filter patches that touch DL building code
    * Parts of it modify very hot code paths, and need to be refactored before landing
