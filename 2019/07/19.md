jbonisteel
  * Some 1:1s
  * Meetings - D&I in hiring training, new req intake meeting
  * Some work on what questions I want to ask in next round of interviews, thinking about who should be on the final panel 
  * Have an apt this afternoon, will be popping out for that but will be back!

jnicol
  * will miss daily (need to pick up car from garage)
  * confirmed 1374570 is OOM crash
    * our old friend FrameLayerBuilder is to blame
    * don't think fixing layerisation problems is a good use of time (very site-specific, will be replaced with webrender)
    * not sure why it affects these devices worse than others. might just be popular devices with relatively low memory.
    * geckoview (even non-webrender) seems to help a lot! presumably because multi-process

miko
  * Looked into Youtube live chat DL builds again, it seems that we can avoid some work
    * Wrote a patch to avoid up to two hash map lookups per processed frame (bug 1533815) 
  * Reduced a testcase and filed a bug for WR background-image regression (bug 1567472) 
  * Talked with Matt about enabling RDL for pages that have preserve-3d content (bug 1567128) 
    * This is probably not too difficult, the main reason that this is not working at the moment is that we wanted to limit the scope for RDL MVP

jrmuizel
  * built and landed test case for visible rect changing but bounds not changing
  * other triage and perf investigations

nical
  * landed patch to leak the rayon thread pool
  * landed biiiig euclid update
  * looked at crash stats and open bugs
