  * Put together a proposal about WebRender on GV nightly in Focus: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VcQ5Ecz-2ijcto8TGnvCEUqeMLpgpeVFd2Vzazo_mPI/edit#
    *  Looked a little bit at the new #gv-nightly channel in slack
  * Looked at some critical WR-69 bugs with Jeff
    * Discussed having a deadline of Aug 15 to address those and determine if we should still ship something with 69 or not

miko 
  * I am alive again
  * Looked into crash with display item destruction (bug 1559699)
    * Likely cause seemed to be a corrupt binary, most of the reports were from a single person. No reports after FF69
  * Looked into slow DL builds (bug 1562370)
    * Display list rebuild region shows that we keep on rebuilding the whole display list, there is some debugging code that will hopefully tell why
    * The page also has some problems with animations that keep on running, despite the fact that they look like "temporary loading animations"

nical
  * looked at the SVG hang, fix in landing queue, considering uplifting all the way to release...
  * there seem to be an AMD specific glitch: bug 1565663
