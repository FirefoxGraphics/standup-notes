  * Friday:
    * Mostly flew home and then responded to some pressing Slack/IRC pings when I got back
  * Objective for the week:
    * Work on revising Q2 OKRs - some priorities are still being discussed but want to iterate on the wording of my draft so far
    * Finish and share WR triage notes
    * Start revising agenda for work week: please think about anything specific you want to see happen, I'll be talking about this in our 1:1s
      * On that note - if you have not booked travel yet please do so or contact me if you have any questions

  * Looked into how mercurial blame ignore works, I want to add a couple of changesets there
  * Removed ComputedStyle refs for nsDisplayBackgroundColor (bug 1526960)
  * Objectives for the week:
    * Finish bugs 1526960 (computed style refs) and 1530617 (BHR pref for content process)
    * Add revisions for web painting clang-format to blame ignore
    * Will defer WR hit test changes until bug 1529458 (Try to avoid building hit test info items for positioned descendants) lands. Will instead do profiling to see how it looks then.
    * Matt had a nice idea for bug 1526972 (MergeState::HasModifiedFrame() optimization), so will fix that if he won't
