  * snapping - pursuing a new line of reasoning on why what we do is wrong
    * presently the primitive rect of a picture is composed of the unsnapped clipped primitive rects (aka visible rect) of its children
    * since snapping can distort the visible rects, the picture primitive rect calculation is arguable wrong -- it should be the union of the snapped visible rects
    * this also begs the question of what snapping means for pictures when its children are drawn in raster space -- does it really need to perform snapping again (or perhaps more pertinently, should that snapping materially affect positioning if done on the union of snapped visible rects)?
    * this logic applies equally to the original behaviour of snapping to the primitive rect instead of the visible rect, so it is possible some combination of old and new behaviour is closer to the correct behaviour
