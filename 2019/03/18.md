jnicol
  * landed 1511433 (gradients on android webrender)
  * investigating 1495400. have found the function which is failing.
  * objectives for week: make a plan and start implementation for 1531142
    * zooming really slow on android, because we rasterize and cache glyphs for every tiny change in zoom level
    * I'm sure the rasterization itself takes time but the real hit seems to be continually resizing the texture cache which grows incredibly large
    * we should probably only rasterize at fixed increments and then scale
