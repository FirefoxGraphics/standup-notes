    * not great without WebRender, but looks fine on Chrome

miko
  * Rewrote bounds calculations for nsDisplayTransform
    * Previously we had two independent guard variables that added a lot of complexity and made it impossible to know where and when the calculations actually happen (by GetBounds() call, this was especially tricky since 2D and 3D transforms "sort of" shared the code path
    * Now the bounds are always calculated in exactly two places, during display item construction and display list merging
