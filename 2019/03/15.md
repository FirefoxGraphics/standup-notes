  * Looking into SVG text regression, bug 1535040

    * Since the fix does not seem trivial to implement, it seems reasonable to fix this sooner than rather, before we encounter a high profile website that is broken.
  * Minor nsDisplayItem changes to optimize memory usage and avoid silly bugs
  * Looked at the display item modified marking during reflow, bug 1535134
