jbonistee:
  * FYI - spent some time on Friday working on the WR wiki, including making some burnup charts/tables for tracking bugs: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/WebRender_Planning
  * Goals for the week:
    * Finish up a few more things I want to do on the wiki
    * Support the Fission/Rendering scoping efforts
    * Keep eye on WR stuff
    * Also heads up:
      * I am out all day Wednesday at a conference (email or Slack will be fastest way to contact me)
      * Friday is a holiday in Canada (and I think EU/Australia?)

kats:
  * Fighting build failures left and right (bug 1544295, bug 1544418)
  * fixed one of the hit-testing problems, bug 1543482
  * more investigation on WR crashes, missing telemetry data (bug 1544039)
  * goals for week:
    * make progress on bug 1542020 and friends (more hit-testing problems)
    * write some more hit-testing tests

gankro
  * potentially finished display list refactor?
  * fixed minor old backlog wr-command issue (needs fuzzy adjustments)
  * 

rhunt
  * getting back into things
  * goals for the week:
    * land patches for fission and make progress on M2

nical
  * worked on the render task graph
  * this week
    * more render task work
    * rebase and land some old patches
    * other bugs/needinfos

lee
  * still working on skia regressions
  * will try to get to dual source blending for angle this week

miko
  * Patch for bug 1540785 is almost done
    * This seems a bit more involved than what I initially thought: changes are needed to most call sites iterating display lists
    * The base display item size is going from 172 to 56 bytes which will drastically reduce the size of hit test items and wrap lists
  * Matt had an idea to speed up display list preprocessing by avoiding descending into non-modified child lists, this showed a huge potential for performance improvements
  * Goals for the week:
    * Same as last week

botond
  * bug 1536717 (scrollTop regression in 66): investigated; already fixed in 67 
  * traiging various incoming bugs 
  * bug 1529892 (fixed-position displayports): have candidate fix up on try 
  * bug 1540545 (text selection bug): some investigation; at first blush it does not seem like a problem with APZ event coordinates
