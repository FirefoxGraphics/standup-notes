  * Continued work on bug 1529698
    * Refactoring the display list iteration code to be less coupled to actual item type. Currently most callsites rely on display lists to be linked-lists and iterate them by calling item->GetAbove()
    * This will also help later in the future when/if we want to change the underlying data structure from linked-list to vector
