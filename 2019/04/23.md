  * Draft of wr android release criteria: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pvdvEU9sZBSl1zeaISl3bKOclt2KBShlpdXZ-oTDAB8/edit?ts=5cbe33a5
    * Conversations around cpeterson, abovens about how to measure performance 
  * Some triage
  * Interviewed two people
  * Followed up with tsmith about linux experiment Jeff wanted to start just before PTO tl;dr - not enough people yet to make that statistically sig. 

kvark (will miss the daily)
  * catching up on reviews and emails

nical
  * reviews
  * some more pathfinder documentation
  * new version of the patches to reduce malloc contention in wr workers 5-25% improvement in talos test that are affected by blob images \o/

aosmond
  * modified my snapping patch set to continue snapping to the visible rect instead of the primitive rect; seems to resolve most serious reftest failures
    * the remaining tests I'm happy to mark as failing / fuzz, except for a dirty rect / invalidation test that needs further investigation
    * (hopefully the reftests on non-linux don't show any nasty surprises)

miko
  * Triage
  * Fixed a compositor animation regression from FrameLayerBuilder code
    * This was caused by uint32_t display item key being casted to display item type
      * Which is UB if display item key has higher bits set (per frame key index bits when same frame has more than one display item)
  * Landed a patch that adds nsDisplayItemBase (bug 1540785)
  * Goals for the week
    * Review Matt's patch to skip DL preprocessing
    * Create a poc patch for reusing some leaf display items in place that do not use index

rhunt
  * rebased fission IPC naming again
  * got patch to split BrowserParent from nsIRemoteTab interface for tab switching working
    * a lot more churn than i expected, but it cleans up nsFrameLoader a lot

kats:
  * put up patches for bug 1542826, mobile profiling support. still figuring out licensing issue
  * wrote patch and test for bug 1544966, where touch-action was not being respected properly with respect to pointer events cancellation
