kats:
  * looked a bit more at OOM crashes, didn't really make much progress. seems like we have larger allocation sizes so we OOM more
  * rooted my pixel2 so i can run reftests on it now. getting different (better) results than the emulator
  * will put the WR debugger behind a compile flag for now to get it landed
  * reviews, fixing marco-c's phabricator addon so it works again as it's quite useful

nical
  * reviews
  * reworked the initial render task graph patch to not change the current behavior so that it can land as a first step
  * packaged another debug utility crate https://github.com/nical/rust_debug/tree/master/svg_fmt with stuff I tend to copy-paste around whenever debugging 2d stuff
