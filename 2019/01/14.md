  * VKpi call, got interest from Angle on VK
  * WR clip crash fixed - https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D16335

  * Reviewing sec bug list, noting which are stalled
  * Workday H2 stuff, that took most of my day
  * Very, very initial, very high-level and not detailed conversations about potential partner work 
  * Meeting with Thomas E and Maire about more detailed release plan for WebRender shipping with 67
  * No update today re: work week - still awaiting for approval. Will keep pushing that along this week

rhunt
  * might miss daily
  * renderframe/tabparent security crash
    * more investigation - no real progress
    * wrote patch to paper over it if needed
  * scroll anchoring
    * wrote and pushed patch to fix nullptr crash in ScrollAnchorContainer
    * investigated a hang in devtools debugger source code scroller
      * kind of gross
      * problem is that the fast-path in RestyleManager is consuming the scroll adjustment suppressions and we're missing them in the normal post-reflow hook
      * rewrote our adjustment logic to try and fix this
      * this will also fix the 'coalesce scroll adjustments' follow-up improvement
    * looked into drift accumulating between repeated scroll adjustments
      * we're applying adjustments in rounded device pixels instead of appunits
      * wrote patch to fix it
    * looked into jitter from layout affecting CSS animations
      * same issue as drift accumulation
    * looked into glitchy scrolling on gmail reply button
      * problem is in scroll bounding rect calculation
      * either:
        * the specification is wrong, again, and Chrome is doing it differently
        * I'm not calculating the scroll bounding rect correctly
      * put up patch to fix it, assuming the first option
    * fixed review issues on new scroll anchoring tests
    * fixed browser_parsable_css.js perma fail on nightly-as-beta simulation runs
    * wrote a telemetry data review for the scroll anchoring probes
    * looking into reports of being forced to scroll to top of page randomly
      * this might be the same issue as the gmail reply button

aosmond
  * bug 1516011 (blob image + animated image recycling crash) -- got backed out, fixed the crash and will reland today
  * bug 1501195 (snapping issue) -- simplified reftest to just use rects instead of images, went through the clip generation with mstange and now stepping through the WR code to find the precise lines that rounding / lack thereof fails us

jrmuizel
  * investigated hooking up CONTENT_FRAME_TIME_WITH_SVG for non-WebRender
  * Our experiments with CONTENT_FRAME_TIME over the weekend turned out to be unsuccessful
  * Landed a change to make it so we don't have a minimum size for layers

miko
  * Has a flu
  * IT needs to setup the reference HW laptop I requested
  * Meanwhile working on bug 1514653. Worked with Emilio, who had some ideas how to rule out some things. This looks like a timing related bug, possibly caused by image decoding.

lee
  * fixed bug with animated text snapping

jnicol
  * looked in to android driver crash. can't reproduce on any of my devices
  * still working on overlapping border corners bug

nical
  * still investigating inset box-shadow rounding issue

botond
  * bug 1509575  (visual scroll position lost during navigation): investigated test failure that caused backout, wrote a fix 
    * follow-up discussion with kats, addressed review comments 
    * it's regressing the new bug 1498812 tests, investigating 
  * spent a lot of time trying to get some Android tests to run locally, to look into bug 1504659 (RDM regression) failures 
    * finally repro'd them (via x86 emulator build); did some investigation; reviewed the patches 
  * continuing to iterate on the bug 1423013 review
