  * made some small changes to overlapping borders patch from review
  * found the cause of one pixel being slightly wrong colour - looks like small antialiasing problem in border code even without my change. looking at how to fix that.
  * still another pixel slightly wrong in another test, but can't reproduce locally.  doing some debugging try pushes

kvark
  * Szeged and Google calls
  * reviews
  * updating and re-landing https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D16732 with a better reftest
  * WR looking at slow 3D transform renderings - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1504590
  * WebGPU discussions

jrmuizel
  * looked at blob crash with Andrew
  * looked at dashboard a bunch more
    * we have a seemingly mysterious regression of webrender
    * COMPOSITE_TIMEs got longer in the build before picture caching
  * looked at snapping with Andrew
  * some blob image cleanups/prep for recoord
  * A little bit of DataMutex cleanups
  * Looking at AVX2 changes

  * 1:1s
  * Re-wording a bit of our work week proposal
  * Conversations with various people involved with Fenix to try and understand priority devices for mvp
    * Sounds like Firestick gen 2, 4K stick probably next priority (at least to understand what challenges we might have on 4K)
      * Specs: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/device-specifications.html
    * Started a rough doc for myself to keep notes for this sort of thing: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JZ9xSKookb70wFNMEOnY9SCuBBiWzm3eSmInByc5uVc/edit?usp=sharing

  * back to square one again on the shadow clipping bug
    * the problem is definitely happening in the mask shader (not when generating the clip region and its blur since those are in local space and don't have fractional offset in the test case).

miko
  * Fixed the transforms flattening bug, the problem was a changing reference frame adding a bogus translation during painted layer recycling

rhunt
  * reviewed some patches for bas
  * 1:1, fission meeting
  * went and attempted repro of scroll anchor bugs, closed a few of them
  * one remaining known regression - infinite.js scroller on ebay
    * only can reproduce real issue on android
    * reproduced some momentum animation canceling on OSX and got distracted by that
    * got android build working
    * narrowed it down to the dynamic toolbar causing resizes, causing infinite.js to do a repartition step
    * trying to make reduced testcase now
