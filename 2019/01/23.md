  * Meetings, 1:1s
    * Fenix meeting - no particularly new updates there
    * Meeting
  * Spent some time digging around to learn what other teams are doing for standups
    * Want to get to a place where we can cancel the weekly WR meeting but want to be able to include PST and APAC more easily
    * Some teams are doing two standups per week (as opposed to a daily) to accomodate timezone gap
  * Have to start thinking about Q2 OKRs soon too (haha!)

miko
  * Trying to create a reftest for transforms flattening regression (bug 1514653) and get it uplifted
  * Investigated RDL animation failure (bug 1509272). The cause is reusing old transform item with mAllowAsyncAnimation true, after it has changed to false.
    * Trivial fix here is to use the new transform item. However when transitioning mAllowAsyncAnimation: true -> false, we might have leftover items that should not be visible anymore.
    * Currently trying to figure out *why* the mAllowAsyncAnimation flag causes us not to paint the whole area, despite us having already built the display items for the larger area.

jrmuizel
  * bug numbers aren't a lot better
  * looking at filter size constraining to fix google doc problem
    * came up with a solution
    * wrote solution
    * currently debugging the solution
    * hopefully it works
  * hopefully going to look at the jiggling text
