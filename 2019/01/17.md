    * actually landed profiler label
    * landed telemetry
    * landed fix for browser hang, which fixes most/all of the other regressions
    * landed change to invalidate anchors on dynamic CSS styling
    * wrote patch to use writing-mode relative offsets for adjustment
    * updated that in response to review and put it up again
    * wrote patch to track remainder from pixel snapping adjustments so we don't drift off over time
      * not clear this is a great solution, doesn't solve the animated case
    * wrote test for gmail regression
    * discussion about what to do with the spec, going to email the editors

  * yesterday's pixel snapping discussion with glenn completely reset my understanding of the whole thing
    * we have an issue where the uvs of the clip region rendered as the first step of the shadow mask are incorrect and everything after that inherits

  * reviews: bug 1504659, bug 1515689, bug 1515774 (feedback) 
  * discussion with Ryan about making scroll anchoring play nicely with the visual viewport 
  * brief investigation into Windows crash (bug 1519194) 
  * triaged various incoming bugs; working with Hiro on how to fix bug 1520455 (regression from bug 1423013) 
  * some investigation of bug 1516283 (zoom restoration issue) 
  * some progress on bug 1492194 (testcase I've been wanting to finish)

miko
  * Investigated bug 1514653 more, it might be AsyncCompositionManager related, with possibly the same underlying cause as bug 1514291
    * In both cases, the content inside a fixed positioned element does not get invalidated properly after a layer translation changes
  * Fixed bug 1518069 (caret browsing broke 3D transforms)
  * Repeated nsAbsoluteRect -> nsRect conversion bug with Linux clang/lldb, gcc/gdb seem to handle it
