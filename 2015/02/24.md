        inverting lookup tables for QCMS



Bas:
        TDR crash on nightly (awesome bar opening)
        telemetry TDR uplifted to 37, and should know why



BenWa:
        Make apz.* preference show up in about:support
        Alternative fix for nsRect intersection more appropriate for uplift
        Looked in linux OMTC scrolling rendering issue, found nothing obvious
        Removing ContentClientIncremental



kats:
        looking at ellipsis bug 990907
        had written a patch to clamp XMost() in bug 1135677 but will wait until BenWa lands the safer fix before proceeding

        1134459 - Intermittent scrolling test was a bad test, can't set scrolltop until after the pageload event fires.
        1019840 - Trying to reproduce intermittent, we do async decoding of images and may not finish by the time reftest initiates a drawWindow
        1128690 - WIP to disable silk during talos tests
        1133526 - Only enable vsync compositor / refresh driver in supported configs
