        OMTC Linux tsvgr_opacity: still investigating, I don't have the issue on my secondary linux laptop, so pushing a few experiments to try for now



        another issue with DrawTargetTiled: the tile offset is applied only after the first call to SetTransform.



        looked at an ipdl top-crash (the one that emerged from the tail of D3D11 reset crashes), very mysterious.



        I have 2 patches which may or may not help





Jeff:


        D3D9 ANGLE issue with Unity benchmark

Dan:


        WebGL2 demo, performance issue



        readpixels stall smaller, but still large (600ms -> 200ms)



        on os x, found a depth stencil texture, written and readback every frame?



        conversations with Unity on these topics



        patches are shared, everybody can now do a build

        Interview, bug triage, discussed the jit optimization, looking into the culling bug





Jeff G.:


        core profiles on OS X - issues with try



        read buffer multi-sample

        upgrading texture client (get rid of SharedSurfaceTextureHost) thoughts, will coordinate with :nical
