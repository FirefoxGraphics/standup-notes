        Profiler planning, bug triage, reviews
        Branch patch for UseFastPath fix for 2.1



kats:
        landed patches for bug 1137203
        going through the dependencies of bug 1134202 and duping those that are fixed (pretty much everything, although it's not always clear what to dupe to)
        wrote some patches for bug 1137267 to force-enable event regions when APZ is enabled



botond:
  - reviewed patches for Kats (bug 1134493, bug 1136803)
  - found the problem causing the Gaia integration test failures for bug 995394 (splitting BEP.js) and fixed it
          - updated https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Platform/Automated_testing/Gaia_integration_tests with the things I learned while trying to run and debug the test locally
          - landed the patch, but it was backed out for devtools test failures on desktop
  - wrote a patch to fix bug 914666 (exclude frame borders from composition bounds), posted for review, will be addressing comments today
  - verified that with the bug 914666 patch, the bug 1130982 patches don't regress any reftests, and posted the latter for review
  - discovered and fixed a bug with layer border drawing for multi-FrameMetrics (bug 1136971)
  - discovered and filed a bug for a regression where a subframe is rendered incompletely after being zoomed (bug 1136914)
          - looking like it might be a regression from bug 1099298 (part of apz-css-transforms, stage 1)
  - posted patch to work around bug 1071018 (assertion when turning the B2G browser into landscape mode) and landed it
          - proper fix will be provided by apz-css-transforms, stage 3 (bug 1036967)
  - addressed review comments for bug 943537 (modifiers for taps in APZ), posted updated patch for review
  - addressed review comments for bug 1119980 (lollipop Werrors about snprintf), updated patch is on Try

mstange:
        looked at debug crashtest profiles
        tried to think of a plan for more efficient refcount counting with jeff & benoit
        attempted implementing this plan briefly, not very successful
        going to try spin lock approach next
        continued updating the patches from bug 913443 (paintedlayer recycling)
