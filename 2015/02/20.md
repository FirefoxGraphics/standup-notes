kats:
        spent some time trying to repro bug 1126260 (marionette test failure) but was unable to make much progress
        tracked down some opacity:0 items that were using up memory in bug 1131037, made them pointer-events:none so we can optimize them away
        got back to bug 1130455, looking into that

        bug 1133426 (crash at layers::CompositorChild::Destroy()) - Investigated about the crash and create a patch. The patch seems to fix the crash.



mchang (read only)
        bug 1134459 - Able to sometimes reproduce locally, intermittent image size in frame tree, which causes non-scrollable overflow areas, which fails the test. Off main thread image decoding might be the reason for intermittent in bug 1134459 also
        bug 1135136 - variable software vsync rate in chaos mode, might be good to flush out other intermittent
