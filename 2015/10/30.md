- shipped fix for GTK3 progress bars on Ubuntu (bug 1218008)
- resumed investigation into re-enabling XInput 2 for GTK3 builds
* - confirmed cause of focus issues is lack of focus out NotifyPointer events
* - we appear to be triggering this upstream bug- still determining if the root cause is in GTK or X11
* - looking into potential workarounds that don't involve tearing out GTK's focus handling
* - please let me know if there are any important GTK3 bugs that need triage for beta



Nical:
* Working on 3 different shutdown crashes
* found out that the code to handle shmem deletion for child process crashes has been removed!



jnicol
* found cause of android OOM crashes
* floating point imprecision and repeated increase-to-multiple-of-tile-size is causing our display port to be too big
* which means we have too many tiles and run out of memory
* working on fixing the display port logic
* on PTO next week
