botond [Wednesday; sorry, had Internet problems]
  - gave feedback on patch for bug 1212745 (adding pointer-to-member-function support to mozilla::Function)
  - continuing to investigate APZ Talos regressions (bug 1210376)
          - only significant regression that we didn't also see when we enabled APZ on Windows, is TART; investigating by comparing profiles
  - discussion with :dvander and :mstange about the other side of the parallax issue (mitigating sites that use JS scroll handlers)
          - suggestion: axe the throttling of repaint requests on desktop
          - also: discovered a correctness issue about async-revealing and then clicking on a button
  - reviewed bug 1204136 (algining the displayport to "tile" boundaries even on platforms without tiling; brings 46% tp50_scroll improvement)
  - reviewed bug 1212876 (regression affecting the swipe-to-navigate)
