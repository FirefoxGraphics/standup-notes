        - Part of the webgl performance issue is that AMD+Intel can dissable surface sharing
        - Rebased WGL_NV_DX_interop
        - Botond reports a 40% improves with virtual tile alignment. But it still leaves us with a large tscroll regression on Linux (60%?)
        - Looking into discrete AMD bugs and performance, hit an about:support crash
    
    

Nical
* rebased the multithreaded tiled drawtarget patches
* tried an optimization for the JobScheduler which didn't yield significant results in the micro benchmark
* (potential) fix on try for the texture cleanup rb swap issue



mstange
* submitted scroll clip patches in bug 1147673. Try is finally green! \o/
* filed bug 1213280 about system fonts being wrong on HiDPI
* successfully reproduced black boxes with D3D9 OMTC in bug 1211615. will try to create a reduced testcase next, and then probably pass it off to somebody who knows the D3D9 compositor.
* wrote a patch to fix swiping (bug 1212876)



jnicol
* requested checkin for 1209801 (tiles larger than 256 being stretched)
* back to looking at 1194719 (skiagl blurry drawcanvas)



lee
* was doing some more investigation on GetClientOffset/GTK bug with Karl
* incorporating some remaining suggestions from Adrian on Win32 printer patch
* landing some remaining Skia bugs I was working on
* attempted to reproduce security bug without success



jrmuizel
* WebGL2 conformance on ANGLE
* WebGL 1.0.3 conformance
* Looked into rr + OpenGL
