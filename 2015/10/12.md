BenWa:
* Cleaned up the GFX lab and updated the inventory
* Fixed up tile alignment and AMD blacklisting for DoesD3D11TextureSharingWorkInternal
* Looking into windows scrolling perf on i3 laptop under power saving. bug 1213425



mstange (read-only)
* created a testcase that reproduces bug 1211615 (black boxes with d3d9 omtc non-e10s)
* debugged bug 1199131, might get fixed by one of tn's patches in bug 1156238
* a little triage
* made the patch for bug 1147673 more palatable (added comments) and got r+ from roc!
* filed two more APZ correctness bugs with testcases (bug 1214146 and bug 1214151)



lee
* looked into mac printing bug with Milan
* landed GTK client offset fix (bug 1196494) and various Skia fixes
* bug 1161277 tracked down Skia assertion/crash related to infs and NaNs in paths



jnicol
* 1209801 (tiles being stretched) backed out due to a reftest failure. investigating
* investigating 1210444 (animation flicker with skiagl on forecast.io). occurs when a eglClientWaitSync call fails, need to find out why that fails...



acomminos
* bug 1176929, GTK3 ctrl-k fix landed and uplifted to aurora
* bug 1209774, fix for Linux HiDPI uncovered that we were accidentally clamping to GTK's scale factor in event handling, fixing that
* bug 1187385, fixed native entry padding on GTK3
* bug 1213601, investigated implementing kinetic scrolling on GTK3
* prior to GTK 3.18, inertial/kinetic scrolling was done without GTK's knowledge using simulated XInput 2 events
* this only really happened on the synaptics drivers
* in 3.18 with libinput touchpads, the widget layer (GTK, not GDK) does inertial scrolling for GtkScrolledWindow widgets
* need to implement this inertial scrolling ourselves in Gecko now
* looking at APZ stuff to see if we can reuse code there
