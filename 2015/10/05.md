Nical:
* fun with lock-free queues
* first attempt following a queue that is used in a game engine (molecule engine), but turns out their implementation relies on the fact that only one thread can push
* second attempt using a slightly more complicated scheme which has more risks of contention (will see how it compares to actual muteces though)
* reviews and feedbacks



BenWa:
* Displayport alignment for non tiling platforms
* Cleopatra bug for kats
* WebIntent prototype
* Landed Vibrancy fix



mstange:
* diagnosed bug 1210418 (new APZ 2x scaling), turns out it's caused by a big intermediate surface on the compositor, so bug 1021845 should help
* assisted Tom Klein in bug 1203376 (SVG lighting filter bounds)
* reviews



jnicol
* spent most of day flashing different firmwares on different devices trying to reproduce 1209828
* bit more work on 1194719 (blurry skiagl canvas drawimage) but not worked it out yet



lee
* tracked down stray gdk calls issue to even stranger problem of usage of _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS property, causing a lot of unnecessary round-trips to the X server, which is also definitely not thread-safe in old versions of Xlib
* got negative review from cairo maintainer on my printing surface patch, so back to the drawing board...





ashughes
* burning through old topcrash bugs, cleared out a dozen so far
* on PTO tomorrow (Tuesday)



kats:
* tracked down four different bugs causing intermittent failures in test_basic_pan.html, put up patches on the various bugs hanging off 1210465
* wrote a test and landed patches for bug 1208023, weird behaviour when initial-scale=0
* made a tiny bit more progress on getting profiles for the talos regressions but still don't have profile information for the content process which is what i really need



botond:
  - reviews: bug 1208023
  - tweaked reftest for bug 1205630 (fixed background regression) to try to coax it into passing on all platforms  
  - bug 1205511 (use strongly typed units in some places), addressed review comments and landed
  - fixed an AsyncCompositionManager deficiency that was blocking bug 1147673 (Layout change needed to fix "blurry fonts with APZ" (bug 122916))
  - investigated and posted fix + test for bug 1209964 (fixed background layer with CSS transform), verified that bug 1206096 is a dupe



jrmuizel
* WebGL 1.0.3 conformance tests
* ANGLE update regressions (looks like they aren't regressions!)
