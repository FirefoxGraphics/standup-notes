BenWa (WFH, waiting for internet repair):
        Wrote up a performance interview screen guide for benjamin
        Review comments for DragInputBlock
        Misc other patches I'm trying to land



jnicol
* landed 1210351 (reduce max tile size to 512)
* investigating OOM crashes



kats:
* working on scroll snapping issues with APZ. put up patches for bug 1190469
* did some investigation for bug 1217818, will have patches up shortly



mchang
* Adding DirectWrite font support for Skia



lee
* mostly finished with Skia fuzzing



Nical:
* Multithreaded tiling:
* pretty nice talos results on my laptop on windows
* less impressive results on linux (try servers) most likely because all of the text rendering has to happen on the same thread for all freetype platforms, work stealing could help here
* some tests need to be fuzzed
* some gfxFTUserThingy need to have thread-safe ref counting
* some progress on the texture cleanup, shared surface part painful, as expected
