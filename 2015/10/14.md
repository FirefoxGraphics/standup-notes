* Still looking into OpenGL layers GLX errors on try.
* Not much luck `fixing' as is -- looks like a bug with the ancient Mesa software rasterizer on the test boxes.
* Tried upgrading try loaner to Mesa 10.1, which fixed that error but surfaced another when using WebGL with preserveDrawingBuffer.
* Also looking into hangs on Talos machines when acomminos' nvidia vsync patches are applied. Currently wranging the test harness to actually run the Talos suite properly. He didn't have much luck finding an actual cause so once I've reproduced it, will just mess around with driver versions and see if that helps.

* skype is being a pain in the ass :)
* rebasing and fixing the d3d11 side of the texture cleanup
* rebased jya' s patch that adds a mutex around some TextureChild stuff to make it thread-safe, hopefully, the texture cleanup will let me undo that soon.

* Bisection for bug 891433, XHR compatibility break on nightly



mstange
* started looking into security bug 1210245
* reviewed mason's box-shadow fix (bug 1211363)
* wrote an email about our usage of CoreUI (it's a private framework and Apple complained to us)



lee
* investigating Skia test failure related to dashed line drawing



Jerry:
* Another approach for off-main ipc

Mason:
* box shadow



David:
* scrolling crash
* old APZ bugs, lots are resolved
* GL invalidation with APZ



Jeff:
* WebGL2 - textures that are 1/2 float or +oes or vice versa; have to emulate alpha + luminance



jnicol
* investigating 1210444 (skiagl animation flicker)



Bas:
* d3d9 black boxes bug



jrmuizel:
