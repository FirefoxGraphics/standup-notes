lee
* bug 1205854 - attempted to land, but multiple failures started appearing, so managed to fix those and land it again successfully
* investigated Skia imagelib reftest regressions, and tracked it down to failure to fill in alpha channel correctly in some situations



mchang
* async smooth scrolling invalidation investigation
* fixed newtab page thumbs sometimes having black content
* patches for inset box shadows



jnicol
* 1165951, 1164027 - investigating OOM crashes
* looks like we might be allocating too many tiles
* which along with recently increased tile size is making this an issue. I'm going to cap tile size at 512 anyway (1210351)
* 1210444 (skiagl flicker) uplifted to beta and aurora



Bas:
* reftest failures almost out of the way, two more push/pop group left
* do we have some unused code?
