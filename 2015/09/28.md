kats:
* landed apz-linux but it got backed out for some crash from bholley's security fixes. matt woodrow also landed some stuff which further broke apz, so trying to deal with that. i might just back it out if we can't find a good fix



botond:
  - reviews: bug 1206904, bug 1207270, bug 1143856
  - put together a fix for bug 1205630 (fixed background regression)
          - wrote a xul reftest for it
  - cleaned up various paint dumping patches and posted them for review



Nical:
* landed (again) the job scheduler, this time some static analysis failed because I was using pthread_threadname_np, no idea why (js engine does the same), ended up removing thread names :(
* working on TextureClient b2g stuff, my phone is crashing at startup in dom code



Bas:
* canvas, D2D 1.0 memory > 1.1, not sure what else is the cause of the problem for failing
* dwrite + no-d2d bug



jnicol

* bug 1202696 - landed fix for pdf.js printing crash in cairo
* bug 790260 - investigated similar bug with print previews, but turned out to be a reflow issue so I passed on it
* bug 1205854 - investigating test case where pdf.js fails to print, tracked it down to bugs in cairo-win32-printing-surface



sotaro
* Bug 1205725(Add basic SidebandStream handling to HwcComposer2D) update a patch and checked-in
* Bug 1206763(enable SkiaGL canvas on gonk) Looking into tryserver crash. GLBlitHelper::BlitTextureToTexture() was crashed. The crash happened when the following were met. I created a workaround to keep OpenGL texture of DrawTargetSkia alive when it is used by ClientCanvasLayer.
* canvas fallback from SkiaGL to software rendering
* CanvasRenderingContext2D::GetCanvasLayer() did not called in next layer transaction



jrmuizel
