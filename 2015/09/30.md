Jerry: PTO


botond [taking birthday off]:
  - reviews: bug 1202050 (contributor patch, second round)
  - updated patches for dumping client-side layer textures based on BenWa's feedback (bug 1208661), posted for review
  - landed things: bug 1205630 (fixed background regression), bug 1206915 (paint dumping fixes), bug 1105832 (inactive layer tree dumps, patch adopted from :mstange)
          - bug 1205630 was backed out, need to adjust reftest to avoid anti-aliasing differences between platforms
  - contributor (Kevin) expressed interest in picking up bug 1199798 (extending generic tree traversal algorithms), gave some initial guidance
  - bug 1201889 (one of the unfinished edge cases of fixed-background work)
          - turned test case into reftest, posted fix + test for review, addressed review comments
  - got clang plugin to compile with clang 3.7 (bug 1209330)
  - bug 1205511 (use strongly typed units in some places), have patches up for review



Nical:
* reviews
* looking at 2 beta crashes
* bug 1208071
* bug 1209724
* office crowded, can t find a meeting room



mchang
* Box shadow regressions
* GDI fonts not working with skia backend



mstange:
* filed two APZ bugs with testcases: bug 1209970 about uniform main thread scroll position latency, bug 1209964 about an async transform bug
* clarified bug 1201333 and tested its effects on parallax scrolling performance (good but exposes the other two bugs)
* wanted to talk to botond about framemetrics on fixed layers so I can finish my scrollclip patch



lee
* investigating the status of remaining Skia content failures
* cleaning up stalled Skia bug fix for upstreaming
* looked into a linux top-crasher
* remaining printing bug stuff



Bas:
* waiting for try results
* triage
* PushDT failure



kats:
* landed patch to enable APZ on linux, but had to disable a test to get it done. figured it was worth it because something else would probably have regressed by the time i fixed the test.
* going back to my half-finished bugs and finishing them off, and dealing with the stuff i disabled/backed out to get apz enabled.



David:
* release crash, fixing some smaller cracks
* container layer construction out of frame layer builder - support mixed blend mode in the compositor
* APZ bug in mixed blend mode



Jeff G:
* offscreen and headless EGL issues from the weekend patches
* talos should be a wash
* shared surfaces



Dan:
* WebGL conformance things
* need the ANGLE to get through to get to the texture rewrite
* may have some WebGL2 patches to help Jeff M stand it up on new ANGLE



Edwin:
* OpenGL layers 



jnicol
* 1194719 - tried updating skia to see if that fixed bug. didn't even get close to getting that to work. trying to make sense of skia code



BenWa:
* Got the scrollbar input block working in a satisfactory state with some edge case bugs. Fixed some reftest failure.
* Continue to look at the multi-monitor drag bug on OSX



sotaro
* Checked-in(bug 1186813)
* bug 1207198(dormant problem during MediaFormatReader loading) Looking into.



jrmuizel:
* ANGLE update landed
