Nical:
* TextureClient thread-safety bugs

* What is KillHard? (looks like some sort of fuzzing tool we have but bugs are filed with no context) - https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/ipc/ContentParent.h#294 , looks like those are crashes caused by child IPC handlers returning false, see e.g. https://bug1127379.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=8556742 thanks!
