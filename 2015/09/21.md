Nical:
* skype issues
* lots of reviews
* landed a few things, uplifted a few other things
* working on the texture cleanup (motivated by all of the recent thread-safety issues with the destruction of TextureClient)
* my khronos account (may?) have been hacked, so spent a while going through my accounts, changing passwords, adding 2 factor auth, etc.
* webrtc video is copying video frames more than it should (if you have high cpu load with hello, that s probably why: bug 1206708)



mstange:
* backed out BenWa's patch that caused tiles at the bottom of the page to be missing (bug 1206179)
* wrote patches for the APZ scale bug with big layers (bug 1195400) - automatically makes layers tiled when they exceed the maximum texture size
* looked more into the way we handle large layers and filed bug 1206704 about large intermediate surfaces in CompositorOGL
* looking into clip culling once more (bug 1136766 / bug 1021845)
* helped botond investigate a background-attachment:fixed regression



jnicol:
* investigating crash when watching youtube on nexus 6. looks like an out of memory so maybe we're leaking something



kats:
* mostly fixing reftests for apz on linux
* also doing reviews for benwa's scrollbar-dragging patches
* got married - ++



botond:
* investigating a tricky regression from the fixed-background patches (bug 1205630)



mchang
* fixed mochitest failures for newtab
* tested CPU allocation / copy to GPU working, works well.



lee (write-in)
* bug 1205741 - landed fix for gtk regression
* bug 726483 - decided to punt on this issue since it hasn't affected GTK3 in the last few years, and there is no simple/reasonable fix for the issue under GTK2 right now
* bug 1201937 - first reported by snorp (maybe also reported by kats), tiled draw target not properly rendered small paths that are transformed... found cause and working on fix



Bas:
* landed the SkiaGL canvas fix, had to pref off on B2G and OS X
* canvas double buffering, some test failures



Matt:
* DL optimizations



sotaro
* bug 1172719(SurfaceStream fence handling regression) Checked-in
* FMRadioService code clean up, got review+.
* Remove  AUDIO_STREAM_FM, got review+.



jrmuizel
* ANGLE update is green on try
