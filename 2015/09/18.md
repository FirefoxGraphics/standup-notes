* started looking at another android crash - 1158350



lee
* bug 1205045 - landing patch to remove gtk calls off main thread
* bug 726483 - tracked down potential cause for GTK security bug, seems to be a case where using GTK3 might actually fix the issue and the issue is localized to GTK2
* bug 1205741 - working on regression in supported icon/image preview formats with GTK



mstange:
* got a regression window for scrollbar fading being broken with apz (bug 1205738)
* tracked down APZ scaling bug to non-"scrollable" layers (i.e. layers not using tiles) being larger than the maximum texture size due to a large displayport, talked about fix strategies with mattwoodrow
* tested Bas' SkiaGL fix on OS X, seemed to work



Sotaro
* bug 1205725(SidebandStream handling to HwcComposer2D) Created a patch and asking for review
* Looking into FMRadio
