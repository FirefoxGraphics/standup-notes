Nical:
* reviews and needinfos
* looking at svgr perf on linux
* looking at crashes on mac with multithreaded drawtaget



Bas:
* TDRs, will now look at the crash stats
* e10s - no subpixel AA, it's going to be ugly



David:
* patches to modify how APZ is tested for usage, how to deal with e10s non-e10s
* clipping on Android



Kyle & Andrew:
* primitive blend support, 8.1 only patch right now, will consider what to do with earlier versions
* unbounded copy a bit of a pain



Jeff:
* whale: dxregion on the window is being set to empty (when we do present), d3d remembers it and won't present until that region gets modified and dx gets told about it
* sorting out why, the backend is pretty clear



kats:
* landed bug 1161592
* spent a lot of time bisecting mochitests to figure out which test is making my apz-wheel-scrolling test to fail (bug 1161634). finally seemed to have narrowed it down to a libeditor test
* spent a lot of time trying to figure out why my async scrollbar tests (bug 1151617) is giving different results every time i run it. wrote a bunch of patches for bug 1022080 to help me out, but looks like i will need to use rr or something instead because the behaviour changes with logging enabled



botond:
* back from c++ standards committee meeting
* lots of exciting things happening, blog post coming soon
* things i did before i left:
*   - reviewed kats' patches for comp bounds calculation cleanup and other APZ cleanup
*   - addressed review comments for overscroll assertion patch + test and landed
*   - investigated bug 1159985 (fling on desktop), posted diagnosis
*           - will solve by implementing partial handoff
*   - investigated bug 1158928 (stutter while swiping app cards in b2g window manager)
*           - looking like OMTA issue, ni?d bbirtles and mattwoodrow



lee:
* tracked down cause of failing gtk3 builds to outdated glib versions being used for our test builds (glib < 2.36), bug 1159273
* tracked down cause of all gtk3 debug build unit tests failing because of outdated gtk3 version used (gtk < 3.9.8)... apparently was diagnosed and worked around years ago (2013) but workaround was removed from our code because we assume the bug in gtk3 was fixed upstream
* investigating reported issue with ICC color profile loading, bug 1152511



mchang
* 1077651- Compositor / apz scroll benchmarks. ~3-4x smoother on frame uniformity measurements on OS X w/ Silk + APZ than w/o
* 1162824 - Update the box shadow cache to cache small minimal colored blurred rect. ~25x faster than w/o cache + w/o border-image-slice rendering



sotaro
* bug 1162639(getUserMedia problem) Analyzed the problem on b2g v2.2. To fix the problem, need to uplift 5 bug's patches.
