Dan:
* patches on WebGL2; clean up in binding rules (there is a good test now)
* linux and android issues with some of this
* emulate alpha/luminance on core profiles with rgb+swizzle
* next texture support (e.g., 3D textures probably busted)



Jeff G:
* WebGL E10S is one r+ short of going through



David:
* snapshot for windows, will now check against add-on
* is it going to detect all problems?
* APZ clipping, last piece - compositor not supporting multiple mask layers



Nical:
* re-landed my tiling patch, hasn't gotten backed out yet
* triage
* picked one of the bug from the triage, need try to reopen to continue investigating



Jerry
* 1165200 - double buffer for bootAnim
* 1155797 - vsync on L uplift to 2.2
* 1167535 - n5-l crash when we have 4G up video file



mchang
* scrolling frame uniformity infrastructure
* setting up windows machine
* OS X async screenshotting - unreliable timing w/ matt's patches. Seeing if this is still a problem on Windows.



Bas:
* canvas, some reftest failures
* transparent div and font rendering issues, could be layout, will follow up with tn in that case



Nical:
* relanded tiling patch
* waiting for try to open
* sigill with pthreads



kats:
* updated fix for linking issue in bug 1160285
* more investigation on bug 1162064, found the second crash source and have a workaround. there appears to be another crash source i need to track down
* some discussion on bug 1166871 regarding untransformation of wheel events, updated patch
* general discussion on various bugs, reviews, etc.



botond:
  - interviewed Chris and wrote up evaluation of him
  - gave feedback on mentored bug 1031443 (two-fingered panning)
  - reviewed danilo's patch for bug 1055557 (handling of zoom constraints for Fennec)
  - reviewed kats' patch for bug 1166871 (transforms for wheel events)
  - investigated bug 1167882 (regression from bug 1164406)
          - diagnosed, working with Timothy to figure out the correct fix



lee
* still dissecting how Skia is rendering rotated linear gradients to figure out banding issue, but in the process of this found two Skia bugs
* fixed 1168495, coordinates outside window boundaries could sometimes be drawn and cause xshm errors
* fixing 1168843, shared memory surfaces can be created and destroyed on different threads, but shared memory does not use thread-safe reference counting, which can cause shutdown crashes



Andrew:
* gtk3
* some security bugs



Kyle:
* filter nullptr checks, will follow up 



sotaro
* bug 1167608(Remove NotifyWaitingForResourcesStatusChanged() call from MediaOmxReader) Updated a patch. Got review+.
