* bug 1161634 got backed out for failures, but can't reproduce them locally so this is going to take some time to track down
* landed bug 1162179 to stop creating APZCTreeManagers for non-e10s windows but now wondering if we should remove the dependency on e10s entirely (would help fennec, b2g desktop, etc) - see bug 1162064 for details
* started looking into writing async scrollbar positioning tests (bug 1151617)
* updated patches for bug 1160250 with review comments
