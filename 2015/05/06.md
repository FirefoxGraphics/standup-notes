Nical:
* xflush gave us 5 to 20% improvement on tscroll and tp5 scroll on Linux, regressed tsvgr_opacity but the range is 3 times less noisy and within the previous (super noisy) range.
* rebased all multithreaded DrawTarget patches and applied upstream cairo fix for the thread-safety of the cairo_image_surface stuff. loads of crashes on OSX on try (startup it seems), seems to work locally (reftests currently running on my laptop)



Jeff G.
* e10s webgl patches reviewed, split some patches, passes on try, close to good to go
* bug with uninitialized data, going for a uplift



mchang
* 1073209 - Reftest changelist to delete CreateSampleRestrictedDrawable
* 1155828 - Box shadows graphics artifacts with FillRect. Markus fixing with DrawSurface
* Smooth scrolling test infrastructure 



Jerry:
* Boot animation helps kick the HWC after which vsync works on b2g?!



David:
* on a plane at the moment so cant make the gfx daily - i'm working on bug 1162064 (causing non-e10s reftest failures when apz is enabled)



Bas:
* different TDR related issues
* crash with FillRect, will make a change on how we do solid brushes, will also help performance
* interviewing



Andrew & Kyle:
* non-over blending; expensive clear
* can't draw directly, will try to eliminate clear, see what happens



kats:
* landed bug 1161206 and bug 1161634 which implements mousewheel synthesization for OS X and Linux and a test that runs on all desktop platforms. would like to find a way to run the test with e10s and APZ enabled but that's not that easy.



sotaro
* Bug 1158448 (Remove ApplyStateToStateMachine and PLAY_STATE_SEEKING) Update a patch based on comments. Got review+ from one guy, waiting another.
* Bug 1149928(short video playback problem on nexus-5)
