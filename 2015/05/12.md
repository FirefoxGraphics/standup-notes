David:
* APZ patches, landing and some in review
* clipping bugs, separating masked layers in the frame metrics



Bas:
* DIBs and E10S, planning on implement it in Windows specific code



Andrew & Kyle:
* canvas mochitest, second version canvas blending ops
* the primitive blend for d2d finished



Jeff:
* whale, now to see how the region is getting into the DC



kats:
* figured out which test was interfering with my async wheel scrolling test, fixed it and re-landed my test (bug 1163640 and bug 1161634)
* landed a bunch of patches to make texture dumping work on linux (bug 1022080)
* identified the problem with the intermittent reftest failures and wrote up a patch to fix it by flushing apz repaints (bug 1163832)

* TRIBE tomorrow and thursday

lee
* investigating bug 1057554, problems with accelerated canvas showing up blank on software compositing, appears to have been fixed a long time ago coincidentally by another person without updating bug thread
* investigating bug 1020340, skia seems to handle large stroked paths created by openlayers test cases much better than d2d or cairo
* continuing work on bug 1159273, getting gtk3 builds to pass more tests



mchang
* 1155423 - Intermittent thought from vsync, seems like either X server is failing or we're releasing a ref to a layer on the main thread
* 1077651 - Going through review feedback for smooth scrolling, have to test on linux + windows



sotaro
* bug 1162715(Fence sync errors on bootanimation end) I failed to reproduce the problem.
* bug 1163681(Bootanimation's fence handling on gonk) Created a patch. Waiting review.
