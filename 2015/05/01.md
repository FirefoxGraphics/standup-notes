botond:
  - reviewed a few patches for kats and danilocesar
  - continued investigating cause of overscroll assertion (bug 1152051) by running monkey test locally with more logging
          - wasn't a race, had to do with animation state not being cleared properly when animation was cancelled
          - wrote patch (straightforward now that the issue was diagnosed)
          - wrote gtest (tricky)
          - ran monkey tests locally for a while to make sure the issue was fixed, posted for review
  - posted patch to bug 1154478 to avoid footgun with LayoutEventRegionsEnabled
  - tested driving APZ with touch events on GTK3 desktop
          - working fairly well; to try it:
             - apply roc's patch from bug 978679 to enable GTK3 touch events
             - change the DispatchEvent call in nsWindow::OnTouchEvent to DispatchAPZAwareEvent
                - (roc's updated patch does this already)
             - build with '--enable-default-toolkit=cairo-gtk3' to get a GTK3 build
             - turn on the 'layers.async-pan-zoom.enabled' and 'dom.w3c_touch_events.enabled' prefs
