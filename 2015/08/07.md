jnicol:
* nexus 6 crashes - managed to reproduce which is better than my last time looking at this. but no progress finding cause yet
* android drawtargettiled - the reason this worked with MOZ_DUMP_PAINTING enabled was because that makes us render into a temporary surface rather than directly into the tiled drawtarget. so back to square 1 figuring out why rendering into drawtargettiled doesn't work.
