Nical:
* reviving patches related to DrawTargetTiled on b2g, landed one of them, pushed the egde padding stuff to try.
* reviews



ashughes
* further investigation of bug 1180561 [crash in msmpeg2vdec.dll@0x25a3fb]
* did some triage on reddit for gfx issues, found http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3cq740/dxva_breaks_when_seeking_in_html5_youtube_player/ (we have a similar card in the lab so this should get checked)
* began looking into WebGL success rate tests



kats:
* addressed review comments for bug 1178847. trying to fix a couple of test failures in the new version, but it's up for review anyway
* will get back to dynamic toolbar work today



botond:
  - reviewed bug 1178845 (refactoring mobile viewport size handling)
  - test_layerization failure
          - SpecialPowers.pushPrefEnv was already flipping the pref in the chrome process, it just needed to be Live in gfxPrefs!
          - restricting APZ test data collection solved one class of failures, but there is still a remaining low-volume intermittent
  - tried to reproduce bug 1180899 (assertion introduced during the recent layer structure changes, caught during monkey testing), wasn't able to
  - posted a small patch to avoid including gfxPrefs.h from header files, to avoid long recompiles after modifying it



lee
* bug 1170390 - still working on security approval
* bug 1180317 - spent more time futilely investigating black image issue, but found no smoking guns aside from narrowing it down to certain prefs
* spent some time looking into skia patches





jnicol:
* trying to reproduce crashes on adreno devices. not having much luck with available devices, should get nexus6 soon
* worked out cause of test failures for my patch for 1176077 - recomputing visibility of all items in visible region causes unnecessary painting, limiting to invalid region doesn't paint enough. trying to find solution
