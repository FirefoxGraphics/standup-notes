lee
* bug 1186293 - Investigated OMTC/X11/gtk3 crash - may be potential interaction with having system cairo option enabled.
* border rendering - After talking with Jeff, worked on making reftest for the corner splitting code. Had to figure out trick with SVG overlay to eliminate potential platform-dependent SVG vs. HTML rounded rect rendering issues. After getting reftest working, my code failed reftest, so was debugging the issue that turned out to be a problem with some trigonometry.
