Nical:
* reviewed Bas patches
* some progress on the multithreaded DrawTarget stuff
* arguing about the best way to take screenshots in gecko (I want them to be done on the Compositor, while Jerry wants to create a BasicLayerManager on the client side). Bug 1173286



BenWa:
* Landed profiler cleanup, qcms sec, mozglue sec, audiocontrol api
* Implemented audio control mute



kats:
* Landed a fix for bug 1176798 (intermittent test failure)
* Finished up patches for bug 1178847, posted for review
* Looking into dynamic toolbar rework (bug 1180295) for Fennec as we discussed in Whistler, as it sort-of-blocks cleaning up the viewport code in Fennec which blocks enabling APZ there. And in general we need a good model for the dynamic toolbar for APZ anyway.



botond:
  - continued investigating bug 1177018 (test_layerization failing with APZ enabled)
          - very annoyingly, the remaining issue is a low-volume intermittent whose repro rate gets lower and lower as I add more logging
  - mentored bugs
          - bug 1120683 (APZ matrix applications) - reviewed patch, pushed to Try, landed!
          - bug 1031443 (two-fingered panning) - gave more guidance, reviewed patch, pushed to Try, landed!
  - fixed static analysis errors in IPDL tests



jnicol:
* reworked patch for 1176077. waiting on push to try permissions
* looking for another ticket



lee
* bug 771367 - finished reviews and landed patches for pseudo-element animation
* bug 1180246 - removed a bunch of usage of our cairo d2d surface customization



Bas:
* canvas work, maybe a memory leak left in, correctness issues handled, no timeout issues
* disappearing text artifact, reproducible in TO



mchang
* 1179049 - Crash in box shadow implementation
* 1176573 - Make gfx sanity test non-visible
* Figured out how to get a remote browser in chrome. Can reproduce black screen in sanity test w/ e10s enabled. Interestingly, the video renders correctly.



sotaro
* Bug 1171257(Video intermittent pause on aries) merged to m-c
* Bug 1112219(Media system resource manager) merged to m-c
* Bug 1176301(Display break on aries) Start investigation. When the problem start, MDP driver seems to cause the problem.



mstange:
* landed APZ fixes bug 1178745 and bug 1178745
* wrote a patch for fixing APZ listbox scrolling (bug 1178382) but it causes outlines for listboxes to be wrong in some cases, need to fix that
* tested kyle's dotted border fix, causes slight rendering differences on OS X
* looked into scrollbars not turning white on a dark background in one case



jrmuizel:
* Further investigation in whether we can drop part of our angle changes for recreating the RenderTargetView
* Further QA lab inventory
* Did some investigations into what it woud take to group driver crashes better on crashstats. i.e. We currently group by address but these are not stable across driver versions.



Matt:
* new context client



Kyle:
* faster dotted table border patches
* regression window on another bug



Andrew:
* reftest failure followup
* mochitest  failures on try
