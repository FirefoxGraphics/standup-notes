BenWa:
* TPS profiling
* TPS measuring switches that dont paint



Nical:
* got the edge padding patch to pass try, then rebased it and now a reftest is failing (but oddly enough it doesn t look like the error is close to the edges of the painted region...)
* pusehd tiled dt to try on b2g and android: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=ba22bcfa438a
* looked at what i believed to be a race between the setup and the destruction of shmem textures, but I later refuted that theory.
* reviews



mchang
* 1181214 - Make sanity test run on OS X
* 1155249 - Scale then repeat tiled images. Have some reftest failures.



kats:
* landed fix for bug 1134917 (assertion failure)
* continued working on dynamic toolbar stuff
* looking into some new regressions/bugs filed on b2g and desktop (1187111, 1186635, 1187616, 1187792)



botond:
  - testing double-tap-to-zoom patch
          - basic use working, issue with iframe (easy to fix), issue with zooming back out
  - continued debugging test_layerization
          - intermittent #1 - traced to a bad zoom level getting stuck, looks like refactoring of mobile viewport handling fixed it
          - intermittent #3 - ?
  - continued exploring |nsRefPtr<const T>|
  - anyone have an Aries device I can borrow?



Andrew:
* Finished shared surfaces patch using GLXPixmaps
* Implemented better drag and drop pixmaps on GTK3
* Investigated suppressed Valgrind GTK/pango/fontconfig leaks



ashughes
* started some work on metrics around gfx bugs in bugzilla
* triaged several unconfirmed bugs and tried to make them actionable by engaging the reporter
* updated some crash bugs with latest stats and correlations
