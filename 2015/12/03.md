jnicol (at meeting about new london office)
* 1223479 - fix display port size calculation - uplifted to aurora
* 1229780 - remove buggy unused helper functions - landed
* 1223144 - single tile layers rendering incorrectly on gpus which need POT textures
* plan is to add a mTextureSize field in addition to mSize to TextureImage class, then make the compositor scale texture coords accordingly
* got distracted with some other problems i've noticed in GLUploadHelpers
* trying to reproduce a fennec reftest crash for Bas but having trouble running tests locally



kats:
* triaging incoming bugs for apz-fennec and apz-desktop
* went to go/no-go meeting yesterday, looks like we will try to roll out e10s and apz to a small population of users in 45, if various blockers are fixed in time
* spent a bunch of time trying to figure out talos regressions from apz-fennec. landed a small fix in bug 1229853 which doesn't actually help. i think i might give up on this and just accept the regressions because i can't get profiling to work



Lee
* fixed issues with Skia rebase so that everything looks green again (not counting intermittents)



mchang
* detect if a path is a rect
* talos regression from supporting axis independent image repeating



Nical:
* trying to make sense of PContent shutdown and whether or not it closes the ipc channel before the rest has the time to do their thing
* trying to figure out if and why some messages are dropped and if it is related to the previous bullet point



jrmuizel:
* got one of my webgl2 patches backed out and investigating it
* * 


Bas:

Edwin (London meeting):
* Patch up on 1199923; will spin out nVidia issue to separate bug.
