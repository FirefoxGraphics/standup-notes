lee
* investigated two Skia assertions caught by Jesse, probably going to punt on them until after Skia update since they require modifying Skia to fix
* Skia rebasing:
* worked around the OpenGL stack data assertion so that B2G runs
* worked around stlport issue for now by just reverting individually some of the Skia revisions that moved over to C++11 features
* OSX has new crashes I need to investigate and there are some new failing reftests



jnicol
* bug 1229780 - previous commit of mine introduced potential bug in unused helper functions. have patch to remove functions
