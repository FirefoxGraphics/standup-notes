Nical:
* investigating some shmem error in ipdl (size != size reported in the shmem header), when seeking in a youtube video
* a shmem is being deallocated and received again (on the parent side)
* btw, apparently, we map 2*pagesize + shmemSize for every shmem segment!
* Tried to figure out what's up with the reporter's configuration in bug 1200595
* (hopefully) finished the patch that moves metadata out of texture buffers



Edwin (PTO this afternoon):
* Looking at a recent scrolling regression on my phone. Kats mentioned it's probably APZC related which seems to be the case.



kats:
* landed the patch to warn about scroll-linked effects on a page, working on fleshing out the MDN page now. also it should report telemetry on how frequent this is (bug 1229052)
* landed bug 1231915 (avoid breakage on fennec if APZ is disabled via pref) and bug 1232048 (regression in scroll snapping)
* working on bug 1209970 to fire one scroll event per refresh driver tick, just fixed test failures and waiting for try run
* listened to presentation by CRA auditor



botond:
* CRA prep session
* reviews: bug 1232094, bug 1232694
* Fennec scroll handoff behaviour (bug 1230552) - tested, addressed review comments, and landed
* overscroll misbehaviour (bug 1231228) - investigated and wrote a fix, working on a test
* experimenting a bit with further uses of strongly typed matrices in APZ code



lee
* security bug 1230686
* found new Skia bug with zero-length gradients, reported to upstream to see if they will fix first
* looked some into Skia content issue on Windows with some reftests completely failing to render, haven't tracked down a cause yet
* bug 1229988 - not checking properly if CreateSimilarDrawTarget fails



jnicol
* triage



mstange
* wrote patches for adding background-position-x/y properties (bug 550426) and put them up for review, tests are green
* tried to land scroll clip patches, but they bounced: one android reftest failure (probably new since android APZ) and a mulet reftest failure
* don't know how to run mulet reftests, might just push debugging stuff to try
