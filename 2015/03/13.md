        Flash bug
        TDR stuff



Nical:
        broken things everywhere.
        OMTC linux backed out because some reftests that wait for focus intermittently timeout (who can I ping to learn about input stuff?).
        CompositorChild s shutdown is broken in different ways dpendeing on whether you look at nightly or beta (haven t looked at aurora).
        Need to fix this at some point when it doesnt need to be uplifted



mooching
        1139090 - IPC / NUWA startup race
        1123762 - Cannot run python gaia uitests w/ vsync refresh driver, seems like an issue with my local environment
        1142708 - Regression from os x vsync compositor
        Looked at remaining tresize talos difference between silk vs w/o silk, just lucky scheduling



kats:
        updated tests on bug 962594
        wrote up patches for bug 1116579 but now i'm second-guessing myself as to whether or not it does the right thing. need to think about it more
        reviews etc.



botond:
  - investigated and posted a proposed fix for bug 1141488 (css transitions slow on non-APZ OMTC platforms)
  - landed bug 1130982 (clip rect bug, 2.2+ blocker)
  - continued investigating bug 1139464 (temporary black screen during orientation change)
         - we were creating too many APZCs in the parent process due to a disagreement between two different pieces of code about which document should get the root APZC
         - posted fix
  - continued looking at strongly-typed regions stuff (bug 1043013)
         - considered "reuse the same code between nsRegion and nsIntRegion" approach
            - problem: would turn a lot of separately-compiled code into templated header code
         - will go with "replace nsIntRegion with a templated wrapped class using nsRegion" approach instead

        Investigated bug 1125418. Codeaurora saied it is a Binder IPC problem. But buinder IPC succeeded just before the problem happen.
        Investigated gralloc implementation for answering quesiton related to asm.js gralloc binding
        Tried to reproduce youtube hang(Bug 1135078), but it did not happen today.



mstange:
        reviews, landed a few patches
