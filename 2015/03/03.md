Bas:
    transit errors patch
    subpixel AA bug
    tiling performance - probably can't improve this much in software
    tiling - reftest failures



Nical:
    OMTC Linux: removing the X11 sync call every frame in the compositor improves tsvgr_opacity a lot, but makes us go from slow and even scrolling to much faster scrolling but huge jank at times. The problem doesn t repro when running in cleopatra or perf :(
    tiling stuff: pushing to try to understand what got my patches backed out, retriggering lots and lots but so far I don t get failures.



kats:
        bug 1137203 got backed out due to a OS X mochitest failure, bug 1137952. fixed that and relanded 1137203.
        closed some older APZ bugs, 1030355, 1045755, 1058255

        1138735 - Fallback to software vsync on os x if initialization of CVDisplayLink fails
        1019840 - refresh driver intermittent, image decoding is calculating the correct size and the nsImageFrame has the correct dimensions but reflow calculates an incorrect size somewhere
        1138502 - Looking at 1 talos regression w/ vsync compositor on osx
        1133865 - Infinite crash loop with vsync refresh driver
