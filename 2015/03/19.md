Nical:
        (re)landed some windows beta/aurora stuff
        looking at removing gfxWindowsSurface (looks a bit tedious but rather easy so far)
        spent some time trying to reproduce bugs on the win7 machine we bought from a random guy in paris (which doesnt have its bug since the single sync texture landed, btw), no luck so far.
