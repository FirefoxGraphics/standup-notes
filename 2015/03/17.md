kats:
        put up patches for bug 1144112 to make touch-action behave better with apz
        spent some time getting a windows build to see what the code for touch events and apz is like and play around with it
        continuing to do try pushes to figure out what's going on in bug 1142129



Nical:
        Still looking at windows beta crashers.
        we should look into supporting compositor fallback D3D9 -> Basic when failing to reinitialize the device, because I doubt we ll manage to get rid of bug 1143653.



jrmuizel:
        Some triage. Tried to get progress on tab switching not much luck
        Advertised D3D11 ANGLE



Bas:
        TDR causes black windows. This is bad
