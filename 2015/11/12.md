* Bug 1223111 - know the problem, know the solution, just walking around compositor looking for how to do it...



jnicol (read only, at meeting)
* was too optimistic about displayport size reduction preventing OOM crashes
* looking for other reasons our memory usage is too high



Nical
* looking into bug 1222809
* more Texture lifetime work, SharedSurface being full of surprises as always



lee
* Skia updating:
* managed to get Android to build
* finally managed to track down the source of the OpenGL context problems - wasn't OS X at all but rather our Skia GL glue code is bit-rotten



mchang
* favicon patch has some shutdown leaks, waiting for try results
* WIP patch to have axis-indepenent image repeating



mstange
