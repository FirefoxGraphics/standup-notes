Nical:
* consolidating the texture destruction code.



kats:
* put up a patch for bug 1174532 to refine the touchmove suppression on b2g. got that landed
* put up a patch for bug 1214267, fixed-position handling in the compositor needed some tweaking for fennec
* built randall's patches for apz-fennec to try them out and see what's left
* triaging bugs, reviews, etc.



BenWa:
* Tried dan' new DXGL patch (thanks!), works great. Added pref and is now up for review
* Did WebGL benchmarking, no interesting results since I can't get results from chrome and edge to cross compare.
* DXGL doesnt improve performance because we're doing a glFinish. Looking into that



jnicol
* investigating several reports of black/white/wrong tiles being rendered
* I have a hunch this may be the same OOM crash issue I'm already looking at but not as extreme.
* so instead of crashing, tile texture allocation fails leading to us compositing nothing or a different tile
* had brief look at 1223144, think it might be a dup of a bug that i've previously fixed but didn't uplift far enough
* still looking at why our displayport is too large



lee
* Skia updating:
* poking at Mike Reed to get some changes upstreamed
* investigating current state of fuzz on try for other platforms
* fixing Mac compile errors and found some bugs in Skia as a result, but there are still lurking crashes
* Android is a disaster - our custom font code needs a complete rewrite and the way NEON support is detected has changed in a way that I am not sure agrees with our build setup yet



mchang
* added a gtest to test querying the hardware vsync rate
* Initial investigation into two black lines on youtube's control overlay due to deleting CSRD on Windows
* Wrote patch to fix favicon janky scrolling



ashughes
* worked on regression windows for https://bugzil.la/1222711, https://bugzil.la/1222990
* filed new crash bugs: https://bugzil.la/1223193, https://bugzil.la/1223192, https://bugzil.la/1223184
* closed 13 old crash bugs which no longer show up



Bas:
* D2D, 15 or so SVG test failures
* Haven't checked performance yet



Edwin:
* crash, shmem hunt



Jeff:
* teleporter demo on ANGLE
* Intel crashes
* with Mason on YouTube blackbar
* WebGL2 upstreaming
