          - ran into and filed bug 1223934 while trying to play around with bug 1222524 changes on b2g
              - turned out to be my fault, was running with an older Gecko
          - filed a bug about change in behaviour of rocketbar in browser app: bug 1224030
  - landed bug 1222661 (last of the unit cleanups)
  - filed a bug about logspam: bug 1224019
  - addressed review comments for bug 1217515 (configuring touch event support on various platforms)
