BenWa:
* Patch to add gl.debug.check_errors preference to custom/nightly builds
* Looking into a crash regression on linux for unwind the stack during debug (doesn't provide a stacktop)
* fast_sincos is faster on mac by 5% and slower on windows by 6%. Benchmarking implementations locally. May have found one that is promissing



mchang (PTO rest of the week)
* Fix a box shadow regression - 1221341



Nical:
* relanded the textures patch queue, converted to 16 different religions and prayed in each of them that it doesn't get backed out again
* bug 1223810 is another case of a page asking for unreasonably large things (webgl canvas and textures).
* not sure we can fix this without adding limits that could break other web content...
* perhaps we could work around part of the problem by allocating canvases using the on-screen size when there's a zoom but some web content may not expect that
* back to bug 1217135. another shutdown crash where media isn't done when the gfx ipc is shut down.
* The bug investigating with roc ended up being caused by a patch in his queue
* removed the single paint buffer code path from tiling (bug 1227542)
* reviews



Lee
* working with Skia maintainers to try and fix x87 issues
* doing try testing to see if we're clear to update Skia, and cleaning up some test fails
* looked into possible regression in dashed stroke handling, but was just an updated test that failed to account for differing behavior between Cairo and Skia



jnicol:
* found regressing commit which made OOM crashes worse on a site
* investigating why and if it can be fixed
* searching for other regression window for OOM crashes on another site
* review



Edwin:
* Cleaned up patches for landing and requested sec-approval to land bugs 1223465 and 1224100.
* Figured out 1223111, writing patch now.



kats:
* landed a fix for bug 1226864 so that C1 doesn't keep failing with apz-fennec
* discussing additional resolution handling problems in bug 1224015



Bas:
* D3D11 upload problem fixed
* regression from push/pop, Vista related
