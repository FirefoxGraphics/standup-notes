Nical:
* reviews
* more texture cleanup work (including an incredibly painful rebase)
* It turns out that we sometims drop layers transactions (fail to send them and don't do anything about it), not often but a few times per try push. It's worrying because we use layers transactions for important stuff and it may cause leaks!
* I haven't managed to reproduce it locally yet.



mchang
* newtab mochitest failing with skia
* animated favicon
* compositor telemetry probe



mstange
* try push for scrollclip failures revealed more breakage, debugging atm



botond:
  - reviews: bug 1220895, bug 1194546, bug 1141127 bug 1177842, bug 1221186, bug 1216355, bug 1221870
  - mentored bug 1199798: continuing to iterate / give guidance on it
  - some drive-by review comments on bug 1221371 (replacing chromium's tuple with mozilla::Tuple)
          - discovered a bug in MFBT's IsConvertible implementation: bug 1221680, posted fix
              - it's tripping up the hazard builds, tried to work around it without success, need a local build to get further
  - continuing with unit cleanups that help with the bug 1208829 patch (landed bug 1220898, working on patch for bug 1220923)



lee
* Skia updating - found canvas 2d bug where gpu context was creating even when disabled by pref, tracked down a few behavior change related to path culling causing some canvas tests to fail, found some changes in Skia's termination behavior with font data that were causing crashes and leaks



Bas:
* D2D and magic and hidden documentation, is it Windows 7 as well?



Jeff:
* WebGL2 conformance tests
* Intel crashes with Benoit
