Nical:
* xrender disabled try push: needs some fuzzing, some timeouts as well: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=e17d285a5db7
* Painfully rebased the texture cleanup patch queue
* reviews



Edwin (MozLDN meetings):
* 1226003 - Media loose ends - patch up for review.
* 1223139 - Valgrind complaining - wasted some time not reproducing this, reporter couldn't reproduce either. Closed.
* 1223111 - ValidatePictureRect assertion - Working on this now.



jnicol (at london meeting)
* still investigating memory usage



mchang
* Investigated what Skia does for complex clips
* Added support to detect if paths are rects in skia / cg, implementing d2d
* create a larger displayport for highmem systems



kats
* landing stuff for apz-fennec
* tracked down one possible cause for a bad fennec regression from the dynamic toolbar, landed a fix
* blassey wants apz for desktop in 45, will be doing a triage and go/no-go near the end of the month



botond:
  - continuing to investigate b2g emulator failures caused by fennec-apz patches
  - gave feedback about an interaction between nsTArray and a buggy standard library implementation (bug 1225741)
  - gave initial guidance for new mentored bug 1220873 (making Layer::mVisibleRegion strongly-typed)
  - reviews: bug 1225571 (finished), bug 1225761, bug 1225508
  - wrote some more APZ changes to support for bug 1168263 (perspective transforms)
  - made some progress debugging the rounding issue in bug 1208829



lee
* more Skia security bugs
* bug 1225977 - fixes for DrawTargetSkia::MaskSurface
* bug 1223740 - Canvas2d allows arbitarily large temporary draw targets to be allocated for some effects like shadow blur
* worked with Skia developer on alternate solution for some matrix optimization issues - but problem still exists that SSE2 must be compiled in, can't detect at runtime anymore



BenWa:
* finished tweakable benchark for webgl.
* ~2x performance hit on all browsers when using a strided attribute buffer. Unsure if we want to optimize it or suggest that authors avoid it and/or have a webgl performance warning



Bas:
* D2D and Cairo implementations for push/pop layer - reusing blend effect is problematic now
