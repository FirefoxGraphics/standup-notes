* bug 1223198
* researching how ASAN builds reallocate freed data
* looks like there's some uninitialized data somewhere in the widget rendering pipeline, at least on tryserver
* setting up local ASAN build and attempting to determine affected GTK3 versions if this proves to be true
* still looking into XInput 2 solution
* getting a working X11 remote debugger with symbols set up 
* can just disable NotifyPointer events, but that may have unintended consequences
