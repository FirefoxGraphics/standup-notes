* more Skia updating - build scripts, deprecated code cleanup, new failing tests



kats:
* my approach for bug 1174532 doesn't look like it will fly with respect to spec behaviour so working on a different approach now
* looking at a couple of intermittent test failures - one high-ish volume randomorange, one for mrbkap so he can enable e10s tests on windows



botond:
        - on PTO for half a day
        - reviews: bug 1219898, bug 1220004
        - continued helping :rbarker investigate b2g emulator failures caused by his fennec-apz patch
        - posted an analysis of the options for the APZ side of bug 1168263 (3D perspective transforms), came to an agreement with :mattwoodrow about which to pursue



Nical:
* Looking into simplifying shared resource management
* more about that tomorrow
* some more work on the various crashes I was working on on friday

* Finally figured out the webgl conformance assertion. Was a bug in mesa 8.0.4. It's fixed in 9.2 which is the current version in 12.04 LTS
* Landed some WebGL2 stuff
