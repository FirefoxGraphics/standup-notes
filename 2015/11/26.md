Nical:
* Looked into an intermittent gtest failure
* gtest assertions aren't thread-safe!
* segfaults don't give the same error if they are off the main gtest thread than if they are on the main thread.
* rebased the tiled DrawTarget patch queue, addressed review comments on the readmaps patch
* waiting for try results for the textures patch queue (probably blocked on some test failing on a stupid platform we don't ship)



kats:
* landed some more apz-fennec fixes (C1 failure in bug 1226864, scrollbar regression in bug 1227636)
* some tweaking of apz-fennec behaviour in bug 1226660, bug 1227241
* removed dead code in bug 960317
* various reviews/needinfos
* looking into crash bug 1228133 / bug 1223706 / bug 1213120 which all appear to have the same root cause



Edwin:
* Still investigating 1199923. Stopped it crashing on my machine but still crashes on other setups.

Bas:
