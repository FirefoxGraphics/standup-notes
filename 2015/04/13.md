        trying to get a mac i borrowed to build firefox (investigation of bug 1151644) but everything is busted (brew broken, mach build fails for various reasons)



botond:
  - bunch of more reviews
  - continued investigating issues raised by the IsCallerChrome() assertion, had discussion with Ehsan and others
          - the amount of stuff that has been silently broken isn't that much

        reviews
        helped mconley with Mac e10s swiping
        wrote some patches to make debugging bug 1141089 (topcrash in FrameLayerBuilder) easier to track down, no real idea what causes the crash



kats:
        finished up the last patch for async native event synth, just waiting reviews
        did some perf testing for a patch that i landed so we could get it uplifted to b2g-2.2 (bug 1149461)
        did some manual testing for containerless-root on b2g, found at least one issue so we can't land it even though tests are green
