        37 fallout



        tab switching bug reproduced in QA





kats:


        away on Thursday because i was sick



        looked into bug 1039818, disney.com gets rendered at wrong zoom level on b2g



        made some progress on test failures in bug 1146349 (async native event synth)



        looking into bug 1149461 which is a b2g 2.2+ blocker, some tiling bug looks like





botond:
  - discussion with Markus about drawing of background colors during checkerboarding
  - gave feedback on bug 1029451 (bug in code for synthesizing events in tests)
         - learned about JS (Promises, function*, yield) and mochitests (add_task) along the way
  - posted patch for bug 1145730 (mask layers and 3d transforms bug)
         - not waiting for bug 1148581 to be fixed first as that will be more involved
  - helped Mason investigate a rendering/scrolling issue in the B2G Messages app
  - helped seth with some coordinate issues
  - continued looking at apz-desktop
         - wheel scrolling now seems to be reasonably fast (not sure what changed there)
         - scroll handoff seems to be broken, at least on Linux
         - unfortunate situation where APZ makes page implementing a parallax effect look worse
            - need to trigger repaints more often

        bug 1139206(AudioOffloadPlayer update) backed out becaused of regression.



        bug 1150518(camera app power regression) The regression was caused by a workaround of codeaurora's OpenGL defect. Codeaurora ansered that the workaround could be removed now. The patch was landed.
