        OMGWTFBBQ: we are releasing tile copy-on-write locks before uploading the textures!
        re-landed a patch that should help with some of the CompositorChild crashes.



mchang
        1149391 - investigate linux composition w/o OMTC
        1149646 - Delete non uniform vsync warnings
        Finished silk docs, one last proofread tomorrow
        Triage



Jerry
        1148718 - n5-l can't show the video content at first frame.
        1147753 - vsync-refresh driver on n5-l issue



David
        APZ in general - 2 failures left, one arguable, one timing.  XP crash, some reftest failures.
        Scrolling feels weird using touch animation instead



Dan:
        draw elements transform feedback test port in javascript
        filling out missing APIs



Jeff G.
        e10s webgl performance related changes; try failing a bit
        new bug of 1.0.2 conformance, on OS X, only shows up in e10s



Bas:
        37 bug, windowblinds?, also safemode wasn't safe enough
        TDR bugs



kats:
        tracked down b2g screenX/screenY issues to get bug 1075670 relanded
        put together a patch that fixes a couple of reftests when APZ is enabled, bug 1147038 - tn says there's a better way to do it
        finally made some progress on bug 1139306 (missing scrollbar in RTL), did some investigation and handed off to layout
        various reviews and discussions



botond:
        bug 1145730 (mask layers and 3D transforms)
        regression from bug 1086723 (applying async transform to mask layers)
        assertion failure is caused by floating-point rounding error, which is workaround able
        also discovered a correctness problem in that fix
        have patch but can't test it fully while bug 1148581 is fixed
        bug 1148581 - looking like a Layout issue



mstange:
        talked to mconley and dvander about horizontal scrolling + swiping with e10s
        hopefully fixed the last test failure of the layerization patch (bug 1148855)
        merged a big patch stack to the b2g 2.2 tree (bug 1146137), unfortunately it's failing tests on try



sotaro
        bug 1139206(Update AudioOffloadPlayer) checked in
        bug 1093283(video element indicate when it can't play because hardware is in use)
        Checked current HTMLMediaElement implementation. Talked with ehsan.
        Start checking multiple display support bugs( like Bug 1138287 ).



Jeff M:
        tab switching
        37 bug
