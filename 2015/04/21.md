kats:
* landed patches for bug 1153023
* got a little further with determining what kind of environment the android reftests are running (hint: it's nonsensical)
* helped danilo figure out some more input event stuff and get some patches landed for fennec-apz work
* hidden window removal on fennec might get backed out due to addon bustage, some discussion there



Nical:
* we need to do something about xlib surface allocations (trivial to make a page that kills the x server right now). I have a patch to limit canvas sizes but we should also limit the total amount of memory allocated for canvases and perhaps do like b2g does (allocate xlib surfaces on the main process)
* landing the removal of nsIntRect and nsIntPoint



mchang
* 1134385 - Silk docs + fix for intermittent landed
* 1156454 - Ensure we do sub image sampling on cairo + d2d
