        global composite test
        trouble reproducing disappearing window



Nical:
        progress on the tiling stuff, found out that we regressed genlock-style gralloc textures with a change a few months ago, the new stuff looks pretty solid on platforms that use direct textures, now fixing the ones that dont (mac+android).



kats:
        finally got all the drag-and-drop tests fixed for async native events, cleaning up patches and posting them for review. patches on bug 1146349 and dependencies
        lots of reviews
        looked into test failures for bug 1148889, seems to be mostly "because android"

jrmuizel:
        patches written
        DrawWithMask optimization
        Synchronous feature status writing
        Safer D3D device checking
        Better keyed mutex checking
        Looked at slow painting on amazon with Vladan
        Looked at scrolling jank on twitter
        Talked with mstange about new region simplification strategy
        This inspired talk about a new tiled region structure that might be worth investigating



sotaro
