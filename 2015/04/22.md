botond:
  - fighting with mercurial; takeaways:
          - mercurial 3.0.1 doesn't play nicely with the firefoxtree extension
          - when you pull over ssh, the server-sde hg process may be running without your .bashrc in effect!
  - fighting with b2g mochitests
          - it's handy to have an ssltunnel executable lying around
          - don't forget to close <script> tags, things will just silently fail if you don't!
              - I need a better editor for HTML?
  - bug 1151663 (layerization difference) - posted patches to:
          - factor out common APZ mochitest code
          - fix APZ tree reconstruction to account for root process having an APZC
          - new mochitest for this bug
  - helped mstange/mconley debug a mysterious clang compiler error
          - ended up being a bug in nsTArray, wrote a patch + test for it
