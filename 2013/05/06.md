* * Ehsan's bug on WebAudio (float to int conversion, device specific, x86 vs. ARM)

bjacob:
* with jeff on flickering bug with nvidia drivers; fixed
* stopped using gralloc on B2G, landed

Joe:
* fixed one of the B2G reftest problem (using the wrong shader problem)
* OMT animated images, thumbnail sketch

Bas:
* D3D11 compositor; ref test failures were across all platforms - LayerManagerClient in mochitests, try to create content client, get in trouble.  

Nicolas:
* Dump() that wasn't implemented (done for TextureHost, ContentHost now)
* there is a lot of compile time switches? MOZ_LAYERS_HAVE_LOGS and MOZ_DUMP_PAINTING for instance
* when reading back texture, crashes without GL screen buffer, why is that required?

George:
* FontHost is working with Skia, waiting for review, passing all ref tests
* pthreads support everywhere helped
* all the tests, full try run on Android, Linux, etc. green
