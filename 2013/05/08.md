BenWa:
* moz2d now has standalone makefile. It builds a static lib, player2d, unittest, perftest and works against cairo and skia (thanks bas). We can produce both release/debug objdir and can select which backends to compile.
* I think I have a patch that addresses glandium binary component issues. Pushing to try.

bjacob:
* working on the security issue
* disable ICF patch bounced for obscure reasons

Joe:
* fixed a white flashing bug
* in some conditions we don't redraw the complete image (a regression from one of the flashing fixes)
* B2G bug (pinterest) regression follow up

Jeff:
* YouTube upside down; patch that fixes it is not a good patch; working on a better patch

Bas:
* D3D11 landed
* moz2d standalone build running on linux. player 2d with cairo on linux and mac.  fonts are not working because there is no azure/cairo/font setup yet.
* some of the tests may be failing because of rounding up/rounding down differences
