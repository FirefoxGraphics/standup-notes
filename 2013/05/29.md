Meeting Wed 29th 2013
==================


Jeff:
* Made some graphs showing WebP vs. JPEG. Metrics: IWSSIM and PS&RHVSM. Both state of the art metrics for image quality. Using google's test script on their same images used in their studies shows JPEG performs better. Going to send these results to google and ask them about it.
* Microsoft got back to us about their 'bad result' on JPEG XR. Their concern is that PS&RHVSM biases JPEG too much. They have graphcs that IWSSIM and PS&RHVSM showing that JPEG XR beats WebP. Each vendors thinks their format is better.
