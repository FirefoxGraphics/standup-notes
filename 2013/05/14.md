Nicolas:
* finish the patch in progress
* focus on the texture host related work

Bas:
* memory increase (without focus), OMTC is part of it somehow - unclear why, but it's D2D interfaces that are not being released
* player 2d - most expensive drawing calls being tracked, performance analysis helper

Joe:
* coordinating the "start" of images of the same FPS; the refresh driver starts it

George:
* rendering issues with SkiaGL.  74 mochitest failures (bypassing out of memory errors)

Jeff:
* core graphics (Quartz) Azure crashes - some stuff is deeper
* WebP conversations

bjacob:
* OOM with SkiaGL; trouble getting DMD to work, Fennec won't even start with it
* mochitests without DMD, see what can be done there
* "polymorphism" problem

BenWa:
* More GTest changes
* Added fling and over scroll tests
* Code reviews
* Reviewed a test build using EXDIX unwind data. We're get about 60% of unwinds making it back to XRE_main. 50% cpu usage at 1ms sampling. Getting stuck a lot in gfx (cairo,pixman,ft_*) and js jit. Great progress by Julian!

Milan:
* YouTube 3D
