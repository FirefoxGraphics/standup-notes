bjacob:
* debugging, ICF, gdb
* mixing checkedint and floats - evil, planning on landing today, getting a bit complicated
* flickering patch, hoping this fixes Mac as well

BenWa:
* gtest
* aspz controller, xpcom, tests could get a bit convoluted with the event loop actually not running

Jeff:
* video upside down in YouTube, on Android, continuing, perhaps it's a race...

Bas:
* D3D11, should be green now
* anti-aliasing skiagl

Nicolas:
* MOZ_DUMP_PAINT bug
* issues with the build on different platforms
* looking at random bugs
* GLContext crash, gralloctexturehost, incoming call; fix the symptom, maybe not the source

Timothy:
* landed the snappy bug last week, no regressions so far
* all of the patches for "decode on demand" landed, need to follow up with review comments
* fuzz bug found, following up

Joe:
* B2G gralloc bug landed, fixed a few previously disabled tests
