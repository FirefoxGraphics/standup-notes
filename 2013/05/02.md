Matt's work on OMTC for OSX - Nical is in the loop on this?
Vivien in Paris office - working on B2G trunk, keep him involved and perhaps testing for us?


Bas:
* D3D11 patches ready for landing, but rebasing got things slowed down, should be OK now
* Chris Pearce's patches being reviewed
* Memory issues in tests after these two

Nicolas:
* Justin's reftests bug; there is a patch for a problem on our side.  There are still other problems in there - the failing mochitest is using ipctab setup, we don't initialize OMTC properly, even though we use classes from OMTC.
* There is some code archeology going on; trying to get closer to understanding this.

Joe:
* PTO

Jeff:
* intermittent oranges on B2G ref tests; in progress
* Skia FontHost review for George
* Conversation with MS on which image format to use (h265 still, jpeg-xr, ...) - if h265 was royalty free, they probably don't want Google to decide what the next thing is...

bjacob:
* flickering on "one" Tegra 4, also affects WebGL, seems to be an issue in the streaming buffers; we don't know yet if this is a regression from the streaming buffers.  We seem to fail to lock TextureHost, we don't get a new buffer back, and instead of compositing on the old one, we switch to the one we couldn't getâ€¦
* ... SwapConsumer can fail, but we don't handle it
* reviewing gralloc streaming buffers patch from Vlad, seems to be almost convinced, with some other design decisions that he'd like to change

BenWa:
* profiling patches, touch ups, some patches in the works
* scrolling - equations and tests
