BenWa:
* Got GTest working on an enable-metro build. Caused a major try bustage for seemingly no reason so I don't have results
* Patch review
* Discuss: Gralloc/Texutre performance benchmarking (tiling vs. buffer rotation, gralloc)

Nicolas:
* TextureHost - want to demo at work week
* rebased paint dump - will land without D3D11 support, it'll get added later

Joe:
* synchronizing the start times

Bas:
* player 2D
* time draw calls, showing how long different events took - will show top % calls
* switch back ends at run time, compare, say Cairo vs. D3D
* working on fonts for Skia

bjacob:
* we are not using gralloc the right way ; is it theoretically faster?
* layers chat yesterday, gralloc chat today (with Taipei - who know a lot about gralloc)
* unlocking the write lock by binding the new texture doesn't actually do it
* Android surface texture (native window gonk) could be useful
* Android 4.2 also has some exciting things that we want to know when they'll show up in B2G
* read often/write often flags - maybe we don't want it all the time, perhaps never
* SW write often - doesn't make sense for GL canvas; we need to be able to pass flags
* continuing the Taipei session - we want a tools session

George:
* fixed the bitmap issue, passing the try, now 72 ref-test failures
* not using moz_alloc in skia - not good
* FontHost ready for inbound once it opens
