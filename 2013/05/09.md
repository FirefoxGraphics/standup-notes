Joe:
* B2G regressions, fixed on central already (in passing), also the one with images flashing
* we should be flashing a lot less after tonight
* optimizing animated images to image layers

Bas:
* free type fonts on linux, with cairo (for the moz2d player), some glyph issues, not sure if it's the player or cairo
* user fonts and skia canvas probably won't work (no code path for web fonts for skia)
* D3D11 got backed out, will sort it out

bjacob:
* problems debugging B2G, gdb not working, keep losing connection, will ask for help
* set of android blocklist, the substring code was wrong, we were locking out everything
* correct fix for gralloc getting turned off accidentally

BenWa:
* Progressing towards understanding the linking issue on windows. It's metro related
* Multithread cleopatra timeline improvements aton is working on are looking good
* Looked into building player2d with skia on mac. Looks like svn skia doesn't work on 64-bit. Do we need to uplift some patches?
* Got a patch to fix a build race condition

Jeff:
* YouTube upside down now properly fixed - the texture transform wasn't being read every composite (calling to java)
