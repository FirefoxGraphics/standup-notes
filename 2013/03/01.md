Six "needinfo" on the team from last year, another six more than a week old.
Is the branch working on OSX yet?


gw280:
* SkiaGL works with jgilbert's streaming buffers now!
* SkiaGL works on Android!
* guimark2 bitmap desktop is ~20fps on my Tegra3 device, vs 6-7fps in Nightly on the same device

Bas:
* watching the grass grow (running ref tests)
* same number of failures as before, but the new failures are more innocent
* the failures are in the todo etherpad
* talking to Jim Mathies about using the graphics branch and starting
* tracing some ATI/Windows 7 issues exposed by the windows update

Nicolas:
* async video works without flashing blank frames
* pulling from the branch

BenWa:
* Found two bugs yesterday on IsValid. One fixes, the other I discussed with nical and we have a plan. I believe the second bug is very likely responsible for some (all?) FastYCbCr segfault crashes

Jeff:
* Android flashing issue, related to progressive drawing

Joe:
* thread pool implementation
* fix some easy bugs, try build, dropbox to demo
* rebase, restart trying to land

bjacob:
* trying to sort things out with the new branch update
