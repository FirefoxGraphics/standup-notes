Nicolas:
* dealing with documentation review comments by Roc
* layers borders display, for debugging purposes
* some Android crashes, if can reproduce



Joe:
* committed all but the MT patches, green so far
* can't reproduce MT test failures, will continue trying
* some reviews outstanding, but lot of stuff cleared up yesterday



BenWa:
* Good progress on plugin profiling. Need to improve the thread sync code



Jeff:
* figured this out: seem to have a deadlock, trying to de-alloc shmem; the compositor blocking is not a good situation; it could mean somebody's using image bridge child as a isurface allocator on the compositor side.  not good.
* we have a standalone test case for the font anti-aliasing issue - it is MS/AMD issue, nothing useful from them yet.  we'll block everything on the old hardware (even with new drivers)



bjacob:
* B2G crasher - a minute into general browsing, double release errors, and crash. manually deleted the actor seems to be the cause; hoping for a solution soon
* metrics api being spec'd - we don't think we need it, we don't think we want what's there



Bas:
* cairo, skia, D2D test comparison framework
