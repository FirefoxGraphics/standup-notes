Nags:
* Bas: let's get back to Brian on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=844954

Planning:
* 2013 Q2? https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2013-Q2-Goals

Bas:
* snapping problem sorted out (bounds related)
* image layers resizing problem (TextureClient shmem has some questionable code) - down to a single reftest failure
* finish the last reftest failure
* will check the performance
* component alpha (?), accelerated canvas

Nicolas:
* async video - robust to race conditions
* double free for async video resolved (same kind of a problem)
* TextureClient work

Timothy:
* image memory usage, investigating
* small rendering issues patches landed
* still can't use bugzilla, IT talked to ISP, still stuck

Jeff:
* text bug; made some progress:
* D2D changed the flags (cleartype to ignore alpha and copy to back buffer)
* if we push a layer from cleartype, it breaks
* if we can detect the broken situation, we could try to disable clear type
* could we use Azure recording to help us here?

bjacob:
* double delete bug, in progress, a tough one
* look at what Nick has done, although it's for Thebes layers alone - not clear if this will help

BenWa:
* Looking into random shutdown failure. Turns out that the IPC ThreadLink implement SynchronouslyClose by not even notifying the other side
* Bug 769431 - Made some changes to support Intel' patch for support MSR features in the profiler. We will need to prepare a driver that users can opt into installing.

Joe:
* we have a bug in packaging code, causes typelibs not to update without clobber/uuid change: this caused some intermittent oranges, not reproducible on try (always clobber)
