* got a working patch for fixing the IPDL close. We're discussing if this is the proper fix
* Seeing shmems error now during runtime.



joe:
* Image reftest failure we capture fires too early



jrmuizel:
* Was able to record and reproduce text bug. Corruption is caused by complex clip. The bounding rectangle of the clip is getting corrupted.



bjacob:
* Double buffering issues, could be related to BenWa' shmem error



Bas:
* Down to one reftest failure. Hard to reproduce locally
* Starting on accelerated canvas
