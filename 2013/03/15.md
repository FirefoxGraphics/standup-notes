Bas:
* Release build has rendering bug that is hard to reproduce.
* Going to snappy next week



jrmuizel:
* QPC timer bug
* Performance on android and b2g
* Seeing layers out of order on b2g, not sure why



BenWa:
* Going to snappy next week
* ThreadLink patch r+, going to land as much of the shmem patch queue as possible
* Refactoring profiler and landing patches that were blocked on breakpad changes



Joe:
* Tracing errors on tests. Browser chrome are broken because of a race on delay startup to open the tab. First draw was racing with particular document load. Now the test waits.
* Other failures are keyboard permissions not being there for the keyboard and system app. Emulator only failure. Think it a permission error. Fabrice will look into the permission problem.
* Running through try again, not forseeing any big problems. Waiting on a few reviews.



nical:
* Reproduce the crash but it's not rendering properly
* Reproducible crash with shared rgb image
