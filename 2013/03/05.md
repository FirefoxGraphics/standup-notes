BenWa:
* Landed the fix for IsValid, waiting to get crash stats
* Landed an old patch for NPAPI 'QueryCoreAnimationCompositingSupport'

Nicolas:
* pushed a patch for share RBG image, for video frames; might crash M2 crash

George:

Jeff:
* chasing the windows problem, reproducible on the local system, will be nasty

* landed a few pre-req for the MT image decoding, one of them bounced, unclear if it was green on try
* got a review back on a security bug
* no major blockers exist (that we know of)
