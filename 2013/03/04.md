Lifeboat or not?  We want to decide this week.


Bas:
* handling reftest failures, shared and D3D11 code
* more bugs fixed in the shared code
* the invalidation - back buffer changing sizes was causing issues when copying from front to back
* there will be a follow up to properly deal with these issues

Benoit:
* I got my test case with all my additional assertions to pass and not leak. I have a reviewed patch, waiting on try.
* I'm going to look into landing my assertions which is blocked on fixing the IsValid bug

bjacob:
* last regressions from graphics branch merges
* texture clients now need to implement set descriptor
* now, when we delete things, client messages the host, we may end up trying to delete again

Jeff:
* tile flickering on Android; bug introduced during refactoring
* try pushes - crashes in media (apparently expected by Nicolas)

Joe:
* all images should display in MT image decoding
* uploading to dropbox the demo files
* rebasing on top of Timothy's bug

Timothy:
* disabling windows plug-ins and pop-ups properly
* dealing with the remaining "too much memory for images" scenarios

Nicolas:
* async video - optimization to avoid an extra copy
* cleanup landing caused a regression in async video (graphics branch)
