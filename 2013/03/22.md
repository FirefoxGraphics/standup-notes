Ongoing nag - have you booked Taiwan travel?


Joe:
* regressions from landing MT image decoding
* memshrink
* image flicker - haven't started - done
* images dont' show up - good progress

Jeff:
* with bjacob - thought there was a fix, but doesn't seem to be quite it - a lot better understand if the issue though (B2G)
* still have the half black screen bug on Android, stuck on it - no good approach to debug it - mostly on Jeff's device, perhaps it doesn't block landing
* camera could be broken on B2G, should fix that; will tag Sotaro if necessary

BenWa:
* mostly on profiling, breakpad; patches up for review, targetting Nightly linux next week, a week or so later on Fennec.  Then investigate B2G
* IPC profiling (related to plug-in profiling)

Bas:
* opaque surfaces issues: bilinear filtering, no Cairo fast path opaque to transparent (bad - canvas almost always hits this scenario) - 8x slower
* will get to the reviews by Tuesday

Nicolas:
* starting to work on the post landing stuff on texture sharing
* looking at reviews, fixing based on comments
* landed the layers border visualization, but got back out, want it all in at once

bjacob:
* Double free, no solution yet
* Race condition, in the IPC channel error handling
* Often in local, others no as often
