BenWa:
* Rewrote how to close the off main thread compositor channel how bsmedberg suggested but found another race conditition. Back to discussing how to fix this bug.
* Reviewed the breakpad patches again. Patches are landed. I expect some follow up work to be required. Once completed this unblocks multi-thread profiling.
* Working on dual linking libxul for GTest. It puts ugly restrictions on how GTests are builts :(



joe:
* Fix a problem and discovered a class of problem: When were decoding we restart decoding.
* Expect to be green today.
* Things a looking good for landing soon. Not multi-threaded itself but the pre-req patches will be ready soon.



bas:
* Worked on a text bug with Jeff. Expected the replay with functionality to help debugging.
* Looked at performance for D3D11. Found an interesting canvas demo performance. Turns out its because it has readback so we cap at 20 FPS regardless of the complexity.
* * 


nical:
* cleanups here and there (nothing big before landing)
* looking at reftests, lots of frustration there (not able to reproduce so far)
* merged m-c into gfx yesterday
* darn!



gw280:
* Looking into fallback to sw for SkiaGL
* Devoting some time to helping with various tier 3 bustage as a result of landing SkiaGL (PPC, Win64, etc)
