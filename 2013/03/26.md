BenWa:
* landed profiler refactoring patches
* reviewing
* Patch for plugin profiling support fix up nearly completed

Bas:
* reporting from the command line
* HG sub-repos give us everything we want
* revisions of host/children are hard linked, so you can't accidentaly run against the wrong version
* layers patches reviews: lenient, will do clean-ups later
* perf tests

Nicolas:
* layers refactoring: reviewing, fixing after reviews
* a bug in central that breaks OMTC with G streamer - will work on after the refactoring
* Linux webgl+omtc = horror; we crash in the driver in the branch, could it be related to the way we do streaming buffers in the graphics branch?  Looking at what's broken, even worse with X renderer activated
