nical:
* Working on reftest failures



BenWa:
* Fixed some build failure with the breakpad
* Shutdown leak is not just 1, it several (typically 4) but not a runaway leak. Not a landing blocker



joe:
* Fixed several test failure and assertion. Have a plan to fix the last assertion.
* Not sure about the remaining failure. Starting to look green
* Waiting on a few reviews, critical path



jrmuizel/bjacob:
* We were write locking where we only needed a readlock
* Giai problem prevents getting past the lock screen
* Got watch points on b2g working with some caveats: 1) Need to build custom kernel, take the boot image and swap in the kernel. 2) Have to use the newer gdbserver 3) only one watchpoint
* State working for D3D11.1 in apitrace. Was able to find the draw call that causes the problem.
