Dan:
* End of last week, started looking at documenting-to-understand how graphics buffer, et al in Android work. http://djg.hootwag.com/android/jb-graphics-classes.html (Apologies, I'm not as gifted with diagramming as Sotaro)
* Learn about IPDL
* Learn about Binder on Android and how similar/dissimilar it is to Moz IPDL
* Last two days I've investigating pmem memory allocation in contacts app
* I  was intrigued why a "simple" app ran out of memory so I extended  android GraphicBufferAllocator to dump stats and I developed a  visualiser. 
* http://djg.hootwag.com/b2g/pmem-usage.html
* Each square is 8 pages (= 32KB)
* Opacity - How many pages allocate? (0.0 - All, 1.0 - None)
* Green - newly allocated
* Red - newly freed
