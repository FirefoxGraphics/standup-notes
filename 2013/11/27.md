Morris:
* 933711 - Wake up too long issue
* Too many DOM event listener cause this issue

Bas:
* blur and box shadows
* font container Moz2D patches, now integration
* stroking text on canvas with cairo bug
* we added SkTypeFaceCairo to the Moz2D tree, which broke the standalone on Linux, upstream Skia had trouble with it

Sotaro:
* OOM problem on 1.2, disabling SkiaGL  fixes it, no caching makes a difference

Botond:
* APZC on Gaia apps - we have to keep the root id controller, so we'll teach it about overflow:hidden

* pushed bug 907743 and bug 943348, finished (hopefully) on bug 915673 and going to look at the bad invalidation I was seeing and see if it's anything obvious
