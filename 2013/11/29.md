BenWa:
* Discuss: Disable component alpha on mac retina (bug 941095)
* will-animate proprosal
* Got a working patch for events. Touch events are transformed but gestures are not even close
* Tried pre-compiled header

Botond:
* APZC overflow:hidden landed 
* there is one more patch waiting for review
* dynamic toolbar regression, grabbing taps

Chris:
* animation article done, working on more
* tiling is ongoing, but will work on getting the performance results

Jeff:
* the beach was good

Bas:
* font containers (hand over to Jeff today, some issues with aa fonts and padding)
* breaking up Bezier long math
* with Matt on blur - good enough for now, we could have more optimizations later

bjacob:
* Now that ISurfaceAllocator is refcounted, replace ISurfaceAllocator* raw pointers everywhere by RefPtr's - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=944703
* A big piece of GLContext cleanup: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=942505
* Looked more into remaining Android surface crashes... bad news: will require more deep changes, but to a different layer, namely to the events that get posted from Java to Gecko main thread and then to Gecko compositor thread. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=834243

Nical:
* D3D textures: fixed BigImage problems (recent rebase screwup)
* there might still be a failing test (not sure whether it's the new textures or if i need to rebase on top of one of nrc's patches
* reviews
* oh, and nrc's new ContentClient/Host patch queue is almost ready to land (needs a trivial build fix)

Sotaro
* Confirmed the youtube a/v sync bug fix by  Audio time fxi.
* bug  929029, fixed tryserver error
