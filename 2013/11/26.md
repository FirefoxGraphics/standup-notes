Last two weeks in the train - let's not do any more unified sources work.


BenWa:
* Interviewed candidate
* reviewed 925448 (and a few smaller ones)
* Looking into APZC bugs
* Matt posted a patch to declare an opaque remote iframe

Chris:
* display ports to tiles alignment - will reland
* unused tiles for scrolled layers
* apzc and tiles are not playing nicely

Bas:
* fix for the compute path degeneracy issue
* font container, aiming for wednesday

nical:
* dealing with D3D9/11 reftests failures
* reviews (lots)
* how do we help nrc with popups? I was thinking of helping as soon as i get all reftests green

bjacob:
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=834243 
* Android topcrasher fix landed on Friday actually worked!
* Only getting a few results on Sony Ericsson LT15i / LT18i anymore
* Landed a new patch to get more specific assertions there.
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=933082
* ISurfaceAllocator refcounting / dissociation from ClientLayerManager almost ready to land
* Removing those WeakPtr's we added to fix crashes! Turning them into RefPtr's
* Filed many bugs about taking random stuff out of GLContext: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=942491
* Having a nontrivial conversation with jgilbert about that on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=942503
* (Side note for Milan) MozSurface blockers that would be good fits for Dan:
* Remove SurfaceDescriptor from SharedSurface_Gralloc https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=941400
* This depends on porting accelerated canvas layers to new-textures, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893304 , which has WIP patches from Morris. We should check that Morris is OK with having Dan pick this up, but it should be fine as Morris is busy with other important things (WebGL-on-Workers).

Sotaro:
* catching up from workweek
* 1.3 regression
* have a 1.2 YouTube bug

Botond:
* APZ issues with Gaia apps
