BenWa:
* Reviewed event tracer patch
* Verifed fixed position background fix for the Settings app
* Updated patch for opaque app processes bug 917416
* Uplifted patches for 918671 and 936864
* Posted a patch to use MAP_POPULATE to speed up gralloc memset
* Worked on unifying cairo, thebes, moz2d

bjacob:
* surface renewal patches, backed out 1.5/8 patches, watching crash stats
* unified sources

kats:
* Spent some time investigating bug 900592 (flash video on fennec)
* Continued investigations on bug 936500 (screen blanks out after aggressive flinging). Seems to be displayport-related
* Spent a lot of time in meetings and watching airmo
* Today: continuing bug 936500, provide a review on bu2g 895358 (progressive tiling)

Botond:
* finished the root scroll id patch, now will go up for review
* composition bounds and hit testing bug

Jeff:
* landed regions
* IE and API trace working
* reviewing filter D2D work for Bas

George:
* discussion how best to do the multiple draw targets from the single context.  go with the unpreserved buffer, blit to composite
* prototyping the solution

Nical:
* Working on D3D9 new textures
* found out I was having problems with YCbCr planes
* the problem applies to D3D11 textures too
* I have a solution (always use alpha texture for both masks and YUV planes)
* filed bug 940359 (not sure it is important)

Chris:
* failing tests, waiting for try, think we have a solution
* animation article

Bas:
* blur optimization (50ms vs. 1ms for 400x400 blur), but some of it may be fp/integer difference, perhaps will go with int and 10% slower, and no SSE2 dependencies

bjacob
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=834243  - fallout from surface renewal - backed out a patch and reverted another change from another patch in hopes that it solves it - can't repro locally, just watching crash-stats.
* Lots more UNIFIED_SOURCES.
