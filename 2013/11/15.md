* Looked into scrolling regressions can't reproduce locally
* Fixed up a patch to improve locked perf and reduced the delay. Landed now
* Got nexus 7 b2g build
* We should disallow transparent app to fix 917416

Bas:
* bug 859955 (investigate why we're running out of VM with probably-leaked memory mappings), possibly blocking reopening the tree

bjacob:
* surface renewal ready to land when tree reopens, together with all its dependencies
* worked on UNIFIED_SOURCES, ready to land for content/canvas, needs more work on gfx/layers
