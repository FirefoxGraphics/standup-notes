BenWa:
* Found why async CSS animation were disabled on b2g. Landed
* Landed cairo masking bug fix
* Posted a patch to improve lockscreen by changing the Lockscreen CSS.



gw280:
* multiple canvases are working off a single GLContext now!
* done in a pretty hacky way, will need to discuss how best to clean up
* rendering performance seems good.



DanG:
* For great justice! Have successfully compiled and test my port of layerscope on OSX.
* * Need a better test case than the nightly start page

kats:
* landed a bunch of stuff on b2g-inbound (bug 937688, bug 937843)
* spent some time discussing composition bounds badness with botond
* got a patch to fix bug 934420 (panning aborts when layout occurs)

Botond:
* dynamic toolbar and screen orientation changes
* another screen orientation changes bug
* zooming out is broken on B2G, compocomposition bounds and hit testing

Chris:
* tile coherency; may have to push something that's better, but not fully correct

nical:
* worked on new d3d11 textures (bug 938591)
* mostly rebased what I did a while ago for bug 858914
* it works (but async-video will need a bit more love), but asserts for running in the wrong thread

Bas:
* compute lengths, sorting out the patches with jkew and matt
* recording

bjacob:
* concurrency for GfxInfo initialization - issues with try,  xpcshell and no compositor related

Sotaro:
* QA team got the OEM ROM with pmem fallback, but it breaks Wi-Fi, so we can't send it out wide
* fence objects and Android surface flinger - fence object needs to be delivered to the native window buffer queue, and right now it's in the content process, which is a problem
* three different types of fence object; combined with hwc, need to handle all three cases
* right now we need to fix video, but also eventually for other layers
* black rectangle bug

Jeff:
* australis TART regression - rectangles we get don't match the ones display items contain
* this is because of Matt's patch of D2D drawing to rects instead of clipping
* Matt will back it out, but leaving a pref
* figuring out how to solve this
