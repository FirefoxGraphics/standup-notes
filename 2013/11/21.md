BenWa:
* Worked on CSS will-animate 940842

nical:
* Got the shmem/memory new textures to work on D3D9 and D3D11, which is enough to turn them on. need to push to try, get reviews, etc.
* still need to convert DIB and D39 textures, pending on bug 893301

Bas:
* clearing up review queue, still lots to go through
* some more on rounded corners for bluring

Chris:
* tile coherency is green and r+, blocking on some releng work (talos needs changing)
* performance regression, but it is not correct
* align tile boundary to display port boundaries on B2G - previously exposed other bugs

Botond:
* dynamic toolbar patches long tail
* there is an extra layer on top eating up events, 

bjacob
* Started filing bugs for Surfaces, dependency graph:
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencygraph.cgi?id=941399
* Still crashing on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=834243 , iterating with 1-day period now, trying something new today - revert to the old behavior of holding off from creating the compositor until we have successfully created the EGLSurface that it's going to use. That should really really fix the crash!
* More UNIFIED_SOURCES! Done with that, landed all I had got.
