BenWa:
* Working on will-animate 940842. We've discussing adding a option to indicate 'volatile/dynamic' contents
* Found why the events are wrong with sub-APZC, working on the fix now

bjacob
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=834243 next steps - a low volume of crashes remain and fixing them requires a change to the events we fire from java to create and resume the compositor
* GLContext cleanup, 3 patches + 1 from Dan https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=942491

Nicolas:
* intern interview
* some time on D3D textures, but not a lot - the remaining bugs are crashing on large canvas allocation
* try with the fallable allocation approach
* content client/host new textures
* talking with some Telenor folks who want to hack on gecko gfx (full time for a few weeks at least)
* what should we give them to do ? - can you send them to Milan, there are others and we're trying to cooridnate them all - ok

Chris:
* tile coherency related work
* display port set before first draw
* display port alignment
* erasing bits of the APZC view

Botond:
