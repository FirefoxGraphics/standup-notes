* Bug 926589 - [B2G][Contacts[Export] Black  screen appears when tapping the previously imported contact from SIM  from a search result on the export page.
* Investigating this bug. Appears to be related to running out of Pmem. When we run out of Pmem do we spin up OpenGL to do compositing?
* After more investigation, it seems tied to running out of Pmem. I notice that when I can get the black screen to toggle, the FPS counter doesn't render. I think this means that we're trying to toggle between two buffers using HWC only. 
* (FPS appears when we use OpenGL to composite?!?!)
* Is there an easy way to get messages into logcat on b2g?!
