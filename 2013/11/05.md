kats:
* took a step back from working on 902505 to catch up on reviews, needinfos, landing patches in my queue (bug 930904, bug 934439), rebasing, etc.
* flagged some metro APZC bugs for botond to take a look at
* discussed with botond some of the coordinate systems i'm dealing with for bug 902505. the approach i previously thought was very hack and made no sense now makes a little more sense so i'm going to try that route a bit more

Botond:
* landed the APZC hit testing patch
* the coordinate system conversation - may have the solution
* dynamic toolbar, having some trouble debugging, need a compositor conversation
* putting together some APZC documentationw (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/APZ)

Sotaro:
* camera, image not saved (detach event not handled correctly,when app goes into the background)
* black area drawing (in contact, from background to foreground), workaround in system app in master, don't have the fix in 1.2, may just uplift that

Jeff:
* random stuff: Quartz now builds, recording on the Mac, Skia clipping, getting a computer for the melting bubug
* Australis can ship without the performance regression fix
* fonts with freetype - we should be able to get the font tables out

bjacob:
* Looked into Gallery app's usage of WebGL. Filed several bugs and a tracking bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=934787 . Have a few patches doubling framerate.
