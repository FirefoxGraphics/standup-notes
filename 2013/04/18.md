* MT profiling got backed out because in error conditions the bloatlog is printed RIGHT before we shutdown the profiler
* Investigation into the VM allocation issue didn't turn up the result we hoped. It's not going through the call we can intercept.
* Looking into the state of profiler unwinds. We're investigating turning on enable-profiling for android builds.
