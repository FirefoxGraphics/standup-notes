Bas:
* I won't be at the daily tomorrow. I found the final part of the puzzle in the B2G slow camera app bug. It seems to work now for me locally (although my build seems once again broken so I can't re-verify).

George:
* Skia rebase is now building on pretty much all platforms, and the cairo fonthost is building and integrated with Skia. It no longer segfaults when I try to render text, but no text is rendered. Still debugging what's going on there.

BenWa:
* MT Profiling landed again. I got two full green try with it (with feature force on, default off)
* Already getting complains about the multithread UI. Yay!
* Jet wants me to look into bug 859955 - Investigate why we're running out of VM with probably-leaked memory mappings

joe:
* Looking into off main thread image decoding bugs.

bjacob:
* Bug 860483 - [Layers] B2G18 leaking EGLImages attached to GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL textures
* Good progress with Mike Habicher, hoping for a fix later today
* Bug 860441 - Camera preview update is not smooth on gonk
* Worked with Bas, got a fix, cleaning it up and getting reviews.

nical:
* Rebasing huge rename base and merging composite layers with shadow layers. Renaming it into host layers. Hoping to get it reviewed today and landing it tomorrow.
* Reviews

jrmuizel:
* In Spain. Making pinterest not crash b2g by decoding too many images.
