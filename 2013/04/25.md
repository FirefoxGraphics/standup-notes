Joe:
* flashing bug related to MT image decoding

BenWa:
* Revising patch for security bug to have simpler control flow. Almost done
* Plugin profiling rebased AGAIN, going to land as soon as inbound opens
* GTest packaging and python script to handle crashes and timeout complete. Paths are under review. Started the ball rolling with ateam for deployment.
* Today I will (1) Finish sec bug, (2) Land plugin profiling, (3) Start writing simple layers tests

Bas:
* D3D11 compositor, SW and D2D
* still need to test WebGL, may do a follow up to landing
* stuff under review
* memory usage reduction patches were backed out (mysterious ref test failure), chasing this down

bjacob:
* use after free B2G crash; the latest patch only covers half of the cases, and the ImageHost is the one that isn't covered; investigation continues

Jeff:
* what bjacob said
* will investigate another approach, perhaps fragile, but has a chance
* jpeg-xr encoder doesn't seem to be very good

Nicolas:
* reviewing Bas' patch
* some progress on TextureHost
