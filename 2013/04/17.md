BenWa:
* Posted a bug for 859955 (running out of VM space).
* MT profiling bounced 

Joe:
* Worked with jeff with the pinterest memory problem
* Trying to reproduce crash with non default prefs. Will investigate if it's exposes an underlying problem.

Bas:
* Testing a couple of devices with the VM issue. Appears to be caused by GDI compatible.
* Reviewed DXVA(?).
* Looked at PushClip2D crash, put up a patch

bjacob:
* Gonk camera preview being slow with new layers.
* b2g18 where we leak EGLImage. Clearly understood to be a opengl in the unagi library. We want to retry on another phone because the library can be modified by any vendor. Leak is caused by bind external buffer. Instead we should do like gralloc and maintain our own refcount. This should mitigate the leak.
* Worked on blacklisting bugs.

nical:
* Reviews
* Renaming patch, adressed review comments. Debating HostLayer vs. LayerHost
