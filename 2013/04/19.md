Benoit Girard
* Multithreaded profiling landed and stuck!
* Java profiling up for review
* Breakpad undwinding worked with multithreaded without changes
* Today: gtest using dual linking of libxul



Bas:
* Memory issue
* d3d11 compositor - close to building
* nrc wants to start on d3d9 compositor, so bas gave him some background which gave him some insights



Nical:
* Reviews
* Rename PLayers into PLayerTransactions
* Rewrote merging of ShadowLayers and CompositeLayers (rather than rebasing) - easier to do again



Joe:
* landed regression fixes
* helped debug B2G OOM issues
* continue to be available for B2G issues, but it seems like the people at the B2G workweek know what's going on
* Not obvious if there are more regressions to fix at this point, will continue to monitor
* May start looking at off main thread animated images



Benoit Jacob:
* Cleanup work in dead old layers b2g stuff (bug 863540)
* Tried to continue cleanup with GonkIOSurfaceImage and gralloc stuff, but doesn't understand them yet
*
