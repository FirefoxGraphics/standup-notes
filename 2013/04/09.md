Landing, landing, landingâ€¦


* Ripc and Cipc - patch waiting for review from rail, then releng to land - bug 854758
* We should really test b2g camera
* WebGL canvases seem to be crashing - probably just needs a rebase (bug 858039)
* Address review comments below (mattwoordrow), then get re-review on part 9 (bjacob)
* Address review comments from Ms2ger and kanru
* Land it! (probably should warn Philor or whoever is sheriffing at that moment)
* Apply d3d11 patch (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/74741329/d3d11.patch), make a patch for what's left, and push to Try.



* File follow up bugs for review comments
