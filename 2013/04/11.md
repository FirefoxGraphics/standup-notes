gw280:
* Rebase working fine on Linux and (mostly) Android now
* Prelim work done on integrating the new SkFontHost
* Mac/Win should be working soon - only a few trivial build issues to fix



bjacob
* Review the patches, see if we can land them today

BenWa
* MT bounced, different failure this time.  The only testable on inbound actually passed.
* Profiling memory usage, quick prototype, interesting results, with limitations. Can't measure if the main thread is blocked.  For the effort, worth the results.

Rest of the team not on PTO - layers refactoring landing
