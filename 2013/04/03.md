Some things are still on the graphics branch, but most of the review based changes are on m-c to prepare the final landing.
What's blocking the landing? A new ref test failure perhaps, some intermittent oranges.


Bas
* layers reviews
* D3D11 bugs (related to clearing the surface before buffer copying, but another one there as well)

Nicolas:
* layers reviews
* addressing review comments
* next set of requirements after landing

BenWa:
* Looking at stack scanning; not getting proper cfi for most system calls.
* plug-in profiling got r+
* build configurations for fennec

Jeff
* B2G work with bjacob.  Didn't go that well.
* B2G on m-c may not be in a great state
* IPDL logging stuff

bjacob:
* B2G work with Jeff.  Didn't go that well, but have some ideas how to continue.
* Don't think these problems should block.  They work, some issues (largest is the leak)
