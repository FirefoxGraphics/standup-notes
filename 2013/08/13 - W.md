OMTC stayed turned on the OS X in Aurora
Trip to Skia - had them pick up and upstream our changes

BenWa:
* Filed bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=904069 (build system stuff in graphics)
* Reviewed bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=904574
* Fixed VS parsing and building of libxul (spaces and odd parameters)
* WebGL hang on hackers new: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=904620 http://glecollinet.github.io/webgl-demo/
* leo+ bug

Guillaume:
* Figure out what is wrong especialy with https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749824 's first test case. (not finish yet)
* Mac OS X 10.9 developer preview installed:
* Any regression of WebGL on conformance tests 1.0.2!
* No new extensions supported in the compatibility profile. Using an OpenGL 4.1 core profile for WebGL 2 is inevitable.
* generating OpenGL constant from the xml registry landed.

George:
* Skia work week, will now upstream all our patches, they're doing Moz2D 
* B2G bugs

Jeff
* video performance B2G, won't be fixed by texture host/client changes
* regions efficiently on top of pixman, should be able to replace that completely
* with Vlad - could move our D3D9 layers blocklisting even back further, see if more people are in better shape with this

Nicolas
* flash seems to work now? need to run fastboot as root, or together with other small things, it doesn't work (including boot looping without battery)

Bas
* Moz2D content for Cairo
* D3D9 as control before enabling content
* GFxWindowSurface or GFxImageSurface?
* vsync and Windows
