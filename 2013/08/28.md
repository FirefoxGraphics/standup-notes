* Setting up env to debug OMTC on 10.6. I can reproduce the issue... but gdb can't understand the debug info so I had to build lldb which is annoying (code signing). Crash is nearly 100% reproducible. Point to a real threading issue we have. Crashes happen while main thread is touching the widget, listing screen sizes
* Working on crop app not getting a WebGL context 908449 - Patched - on try
* This would of been caught if we didn't turn off our webgl tests, bjacob filed 909903
* Looking into genlock failure. Caused by a timeout. Need to find other side locking it

Guillaume:
* Debuging the WebGL ext OES_texture_half_float, GL_HALF_FLOAT_OES != GL_HALF_FLOAT
* Replacing a exception by a return null on getContext like as said in spec for a canvas
* Writing a WebGL Conformance test for the execption thrown by getContext
* OpenGL version workaround on the emulator (since it's faking OGL ES2 on OGL 3.2)

bjacob:
* gralloc textures reviewed
* git android repos, for the emulator changes
* with Snorp on minimal sizes for SkiaGL - will add a new preference for the threshold size
* with Guillaume, need to do a recommendation about the internship

Nicolas:
* planning to land gralloc textures when inbound opens
* buri build environment
* some problems with Gaia, can't reproduce problems (gallery issues before we get there)
