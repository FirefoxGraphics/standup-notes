Jeff:
* Windows - looked with Connely and BenWa on TART results - GDI readback showed up. Bug is filed. Three possible solutions.  D3D9 layers is a problem?
* video performance.  Media server with genlock contention - gralloc textures are attached until we draw the next one, but release to media server once the image bridge transaction is completed.  That old buffer can't be used until the draw happens.
