May want to track https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=908033 (Render profiler suite - B2G driven)


Guillaume:
* Fix HTMLCanvasElement::GetContext throwing a exception if WebGL context creation fails.
* GL_VERSION parser finaly landed.
* OES_texture_half_float continuing.

gw280:
* Bug 903993 is what I'm looking at still
* Basically this is a crash in the Skia glue code for NPAPI with Android. Flash asks for the filename of the typeface we're using, and we call getFileName() on the SkStream object. The object isn't of type SkFILEStream so doesn't have a filename, and we don't nullptr check it.
* Can workaround this quickly for now by nullptr checking getFileName and it no longer crashes, but I'm trying to investigate why we aren't getting an SkFILEStream, as my understanding is that we should be.

BenWa:
* Worked on the 10.6 video bug. I though I could use setStyleMask but it doesn't work after the window creation. I think we should disable the test :(
* Profiler review

bjacob:
* emulator patch landed, with help from mwu
* largest issue left for B2G SkiaGL is cache sizing Snorp is working on and size threshold for SkiaGL and running mochitest
* trying to get Guillaume invited to the summit

Nicolas:
* helped snorp on surface stream issue
* landed gralloc textures, pref is still on the old textures on B2G
* there was a camera regression on buri, doesn't look like a layers problem 
* can't run the B2G emulator anymore
