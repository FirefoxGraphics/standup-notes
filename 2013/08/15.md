BenWa:
* Reviewed 898919, 890280, 747811
* Emailed Eclipse CDT for help on generating a Eclipse project from our build - Just want to scope it out
* Scoped out generating a XCode project: Project listing, code completion, calling out to ninja for build should be 1 man day.
* Interviewed performance candidate
* 2 week silence from NVidia on bug 859571, followed up.
* Patch for B2G to disable driver to fall back from pmem to ashmem and instead fail allocation
* Metro profiler bug 886555 - Should I request a metro license and jump in to help?

George:
* B2G build, looking at the gallery crash next 901705

Nicolas:
* Is OMTC OSX blocked on new textures?  We use new textures, so it needs it on by pref. Matt is taking care of the small things.

Jeff:
* B2G video performance patch (that slowed it down instead of sped it up) - don't know why, but now we don't skip frames, at least - we have the answer for that now.  The guess is that we're overconsuming on the compositor?
* Half day off yesterday

Guillaume:
* Try my last ideas to find the bug in 749824 : dead end.
* Implement transform feedback queries
* Building on 10.9 is burning, bisecting.
* When have a chance will look at intermittent orange 886999
