Guillaume:
* Crash of EXT_packed_depth_stencil on OS X 10.9 seams to be fixed : re-enabling it for 10.9
* Transform feedback queries landed
* GLFeature fixing colisions and landing
* Done the intern presentation.

Bas:
* Wrote the patch for the Moz2D D3D9 workaround
* Worked more with Matt Woodrow on Moz2D D3D9 and Moz2D basic, the latter is also green
* Reviewed some code
* Looked at some VBO stuff Andreas brought up
* Investigated TART profiles for the new Australis UI and gave feedback on them

BenWa:
* B2G camera bug - Need to remove the SurfaceDescriptor from content if it's in the compositor
* B2G lock screen resets the debugging
* Have a fix for the frame-counter patch to properly invalidate the widget
* Wrote a peer review

Jeff:
* Tuesday was great, Wednesday not so great
* talked with Sotaro about the gralloc attach/draw/disconnect - Android does swap on draw as well, so we can't be the same on B2G unless we also change to swap on draw
* putting together a patch to try some approaches (no GL context during swap?) currently crashes or has strange lines (bad locking?)
* region ref test failures
* DIB section stuff - are we creating textures on every D3D9 draw?

bjacob:
* landed GfxInfo on Gonk - stuck
* deplying the emulator fix
* deprecating tests
* not using SkiaGL on small canvases

Nicolas:
* blog post on Moz2D, linked to mentored bug
* looking at regressions from new textures on gralloc
* the try is not looking good - was using gralloc on all video frames, and that may not be what we want to do immediatelly - we weren't doing it before - one of the reasons for crashing
* emulator stopped working, after rebase, needed to work more on it
