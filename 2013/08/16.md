BenWa:

* Setup metro bug and looked into metro bug
* re-reviewed tiling patch
* Looking into 902927

Guillaume:
* Did a workaround for the OS X 10.9 build bustage 901348
* Searching informations about frequent crash 886999 : can't be reproduced localy.
* Crashes on 10.7.2 and 10.8
* Crashes on 10.8 are all triggered by /tests/content/media/webspeech/recognition/test/test_nested_eventloop.html
* Complete GLContext's feature queries and let WebGL use it landed
* Optimise WebGL 2 occlusion queries landed
* WebGL 2 RASTERIZER_DISCARD landed

Jeff:
* B2G video bug - when we dispatch an event, we give it image container, rather than image, so we may end up skipping frames
* the region patch is in bad shape on try
* all gfx stuff moving out of main ipc header, into graphics specific - should help us from including graphics headers in most files in the tree

Bas:
* Moz2D Cairo - sync some fonts
* copy glyphs code in progress
* need fallbacks when we can't wrap accelerated surface into cairo
* vsync conversation
* a bug from jessup too much blocking

Bjacob:
* tracking bug for Skia/GL in B2G 1.2 (huge priority!!) https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=905214
* all blockers "under control", should be regular labor from here onwards... fingers crossed, can be accelerated by having one more person on it if that's an option
* Pushing the emulator bgra patch is blocked on getting a hold of Michael Wu.
* Fixed b2g documentation:
* How to run b2g reftests: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Platform/Testing/Reftests
* How to build b2g emulator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites#Emulator_build_issues
