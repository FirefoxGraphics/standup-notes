B2G camera - a canary in a coal mine.   It's dangerous to make changes to graphics code without trying the camera on B2G.  Video, and still, recording and playing back.


Matt:
* texture failures and leaks patches, with texture host / client
* implemented for canvas

Guillaume:
* landed GL context uplift
* generate all OpenGL constants from the XML registry (python script)
* WebGL bug reported, extension management

Joe:
* communicating frames to compositor, deal with some previous patch regressions
* up for reviews
* finish this up today

BenWa:
* APZC work
* Talos: Tested patch to mach, discussed plan with avih
* Fixed up old gfx unit tests

Jeff:
* modified regions code working (on top of pixman regions code)
* better here is defined as performance to get there
* we don't want to draw each rect individually
* test for page faulting - first time we use after allocation is 6-10x slower than afterwards

bjacob:
* mochitest failures on B2G with SkiaGL - one pixel differences - there were some differences in the test itself - turns out we need GfxInfo for B2G
* next: reftest failures - some are going to be related to the above
* helping with 900012 triage

Nical:
* working on regression bug 900012
* lots of reviews for matt's patches (new textures related stuff)

Bas:
* siggraph report
* performance testing on D2D - all our performance problems seem to be draw target creation, source surface creation, gradient creation - once those are out, we get better performance than cairo or skia, even for static rendering
* at places we have two copies, perhaps we can take care of that
