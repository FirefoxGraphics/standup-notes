BenWa:
* Landed bug 914348 (naming profiler thread) - backout because of missing pthread library for xpcshell?
* Have local patch to profile compositer well now. Trying to land them all
* Profiled contacts and settings app. BrowserElementPanning.js is taking a lot of our scroll budget
* http://people.mozilla.org/~bgirard/cleopatra/#report=1502035bb127ab8c08c3deef3463e54c4880945d
* Compositor is mostly idle during settings app scrolling
* Binding gralloc texture is 60% of our composite times
* Disabling active layers nearly doubles our FPS

Discussion:
* Azure Basic for content causes sizable Tart regression. Backout?  YES
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=907926#c25

bjacob:
* B2G crash with gralloc buffer actor; the patch is landed
* looking at GFXB2G1.2 blockers, will find one

Nicolas:
* Frame ordering
* Looking at what other crashes/correctness

Jeff:
* we don't have a good handle on the slow startup on video - who can look at it
* regions talos regressions - differential profile with perf, but not useful
* with bjacob on the gralloc crash
* Australis profiles, gave direction to Conley
* D3D9 issues to nrc

George:
* goko.com on Android/Nightly w/SkiaGL is unusably slow. Filed a bug to track performance of that.
* Try run of skia rebase is mostly green now: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=69cbaf36bfd1
* I know what the reftest failures are, can fix those today
* Will investigate blendops today as well
* Also setting up b2g nexus 4 build on the side today
