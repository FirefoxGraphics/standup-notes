BenWa:
* Marker stacks landed, need to perform follow up ui work.
* 920909: Tested plugin profiling. Wrote patch to fix syncing code on try.
* Profiled b2g scrolling. un rotating a buffer is causing us to allocate a new gralloc buffer which is slow (5-10ms). Working on a patch for that. Details: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=915120#c3

Bas:
* patch reviews for nrc, have to change the approach
* cairo path, green on try and fixes a Moz2D SW rendering bug
* have to check on the filter stuff

Nicolas:
* the game oom bug
* DMD related issues
* with Woodrow on async video related patches

Jeff:
* regions regression, having trouble even getting the useful profiles

Sotaro:
* video playback problem on a particular codec - need to track system properties
* MCP audio playback freeze, variable bit rate support, too much cache
* HWC/pmem - will aim for the internal to graphics buffer support, but camera initialization needs pmem

bjacob:
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=914823 - SharedSurface_Gralloc crash - Fixed! Thanks to Sotaro & Jlin for getting me a debuggable hamachi, and to Nical & BenWa for useful conversations.
* Refgraph working again on B2G & desktop linux - https://github.com/bjacob/mozilla-central/wiki/Refgraph
* Used refgraph to debug WebGL leak https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=902922 (seems to be just JS holding on to stuff, not a leak) and B2G leak https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=918978 (is perhaps media/mp3 related, need DMD to know more (cf. Nical))
* Replied on public-webgl about WEBGL_security_sensitive_resources
