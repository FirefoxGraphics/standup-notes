nical:
* working on getting the new textures to work on B2G
* 1) ensure we never share a texture with 2 compositables
* 2) ensure that we never call RemoveTextureClient manually
* so far, managed to make it crash less but M3 is still red :(

Bas:
* Moz2D cairo performance (try still has performance regressions)

Jeff:
* reviews
* AMD/MS bug, going for the support ticket
* with Vlad on what Dan G could start working on

George:
* rebase builds and runs - not passing try
* overrunning cache limits - no OOM in mochitests, but didn't seem to fix all

Sotaro:
* native window work, waiting for reviews on some patches
* using updated patch from Nicolas, seems video is rendering correctly now
* need to confirm more today
