BenWa:
* Looked with jchen at some ANR report. We seem to have a high volume of deadlock while switching our EGLSurface. Landed profiler labels to diagnose that.
* Gived Dan a profiler tutorial
* Got the visibility computed against the clip. If I don't find any more bugs I can use it against the clip and shouldn't be long

George:
* Didn't manage to get work done on Friday due to NEXUS interview, so will be taking PTO retroactively for that.
* No real status update as a result; Linux still working, performance still regressed (with Skia rebase and Azure/SkiaGL canvas).
* Can't make today's daily due to a financial meeting :/

Bas:
* path on cairo code, patch for feedback, this gives us Moz2D for drawing everywhere
* with Markus, finalizing the filters, helping him land

Jeff:
* image related work - colour spaces, patches, etc.
* looking at profiles, including UX

Sotaro:

* PTO 
* Nightly has badly regressed WebGL demos
