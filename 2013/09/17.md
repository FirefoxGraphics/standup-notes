BenWa:
* Interviewed candidate
* Several profiler Q&A for b2g
* patch revision for fill ratio, layer dumping
* mobile stability meeting
* r+ for profile.sh, waiting on pull request
* Discussed reducing overdraw on b2g. Need to mark application RenderFrame as opaque
* Tested Kill-a-watt. We range between 0.5 Watt (screen off), 1 Watt screen on idle, 1.5-2 Watts scrolling

gw280:
* Found root cause of reftest bug, due to comparing function pointers and the way the inlines are done
* Jeff and I concluded that we shouldn't care about the failing tests anyway
* Rebase is green (the failing reftest on windows should be disabled) https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Graphics
* Can land whenever uplift has happened
* Flash is working too

Nicolas:
* emulator works now, the graphics drivers were not working properly
* webgl on the emulator is broken
* camera app has frame ordering problem on the emulator, looks like it's ok to ignore
* investigating shutdown issues with image bridge (shutdown protocol never called?)

Jeff:
* region issues
* gradient regression

bjacob:
* gralloc buffer actor crash 915869

Sotaro:
* bypass gralloc buffer allocation - image bridge is slow - using binder instead
