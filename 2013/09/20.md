BenWa:
* Reviewed 918078
* Wrote a patch to merge secondary threads when profiling 918581 - landed
* Landed patch to add payload to markers
* Wrote a patch to fix a bug threaded profiling bug and remove a footgun
* Helped Sotaro profile the camera app startup
* Working on the culling. Have some bugs with transform I need to fix first
* Looking into marker relationship

bjacob:
* Looked at Android 4.3 GL errors with Kats - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=900020
* Helped jrmuizel with the WebGL backend for his 2D rasterizer
* Lots of patches to make gfxASurface cheaper to include, which involves: add AutoPtr to MFBT, and split cheap stuff out of nscore.h
* Figured why touching gfx headers caused netwerk/ to recompile: it goes through PBrowser.h including gfx headers. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=918651

Sotaro:
* camera startup latency, camera hardware initialization takes the most time (1.5s vs 30ms for the ImageBridge part).  Unagi was much better on this. Habicher is going to ask CodeAurora on this.

Jeff:
* rasterizer demo for shumway (stays on the worker, emscripten c++, in the style of Flash, so full flexibility over canvas because we don't need to spec)
* webp image study and results confusion - needed a new patch to get saner results

Dan:
* learning the code, extensions to WebGL; sRGB support first
* hardware composer and surface flinger on Android, investigating

George, Bas, Nicolas:
* PTO
