Ref counted IPDL actors. - bjacob with Sotaro and bent
SkiaGL cache size - Snorp looking at this
Buffer rotation vs. not at all


Bas:
* landed the cairo path patches, seems to have stuck
* summit presentation, will send out the slides
* Have the x86 Metro tablet, not in a good shape - jitter, latency, correctness, zoom-in doesn't rasterize

Jeff:
* profiling

BenWa:
* Worked on buffer rotation. I'm close but it looks like a small bug debugging it now.
* Played with vagrant this weekend for b2g. Would be cool but you need a device

Sotaro:
* SkiaGL cache contributing to OOM, music application in trouble
* Nexus 4 media playback - unstable lately
* pmem, codeaurora

Nicolas:
* landing patches (including quirks, where we have backend specific data in the compositables, one EGL image per compositable, rather than texture)
* texture flags handling patch
* new textures in fennec, on try, last OGL platform , would get fennec test coverage to now exercise the new textures code

James:
* fixing Skia cache (LRU, once at maximum size, we're in trouble).  Skia team is open to changing this, so we'll see what .  Maybe try purging.

bjacob:
* WebGL depth textures now work with ANGLE
* fake black texture system
