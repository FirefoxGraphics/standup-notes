BenWa:
* CopyBit is broken on master. Debuged the cause but mwu had the fix underway already. Worked was to disable HWC on b2g. Should be good now
* Worked on OMTC windowed plugins for windows. Looking into hosting the plugin window in our layer tree for async scrolling. Looks easy
* Updating patch for win OMTC basic glass

Nicolas:
* frame ordering for H264 901224
* crash at the end of the video, with the fix leaks TextureHost
* new textures are enabled on non SkiaGL canvases.  Thebes & WebGL use deprecated textures.
* Jeff will take a crash 912725

bjacob:
* running mochitest twice - working with the A team

Jeff:
* Will take crash 912725 from Nicolas
* Shumway meeting - told them what's reasonable and what there is time for

George:
* Security crash that takes down XP - it looks like PGO + Matt Woodrow's change
* looking for hardware to reproduce this
