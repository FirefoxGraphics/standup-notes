What should we do with - Bug 914984 - Enable Azure content for b2g 
gecko/b2g/app/b2g.js - layers.force-tiles


--------------



BenWa:
* Landed patch 810526 for jld
* Looked into tiling
* d3dsurface9 cairo topcrasher diagnostic

gw280:
* https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Graphics
* That's the skia rebase. Should be fully green now.
* We can potentially land today
* Advanced blendops are all green! Whee!



Side stuff:
* B2G Nexus 4 dev env set up now on my laptop
* Finally landed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=899672 (I forgot I hadn't landed it)



Nicolas:
* frame ordering, got it green eventually, landed on inbound
* new textures on Fennec - it regresses one thing - not tested on B2G, but probably have the same problem there

bjacob
* with jrmuizel: triaged GFXB2G1.2
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=914776
* bisected down to 1 cset (had to fix the boot)
* proved it's a regression from the last libui upgrade (widget:gonk bug, not gfx bug)
* started work on bisecting 914390, 914870
* talked with gal about the possibility that choice of GL texture unit might affect performance. talked to the qualcomm person who seemed to have mentioned that; seems to turn out that he meant texture, not texture unit, so there is nothing to see here. For reference: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912134#c66
* talked with google maps people who wanted again a magic way to know if webgl is going to be slow. Told them again that they have no alternative to actual performance measurements. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=915446

Jeff:
* with bjacob, with BenWa on tiling
* with josh on webp
* b2g performance
