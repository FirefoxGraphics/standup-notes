Kats:
* APZC tuning, coordinating with AJones

Chris:
* async scrolling, fixed position  only works in the browser on B2G
* is it just broken for scrollable subframes?

Performance:
* no solution on the uncached - VIncent will talk to the vendor
* writing into the surface is slow

Tiling:
* will try to raise the priority

Image decoding:
* asked for design, will take it from there
