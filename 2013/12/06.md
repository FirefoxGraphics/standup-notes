Metro, MozSurface, Performance


Cwiiis:
* was working on APZC issues, specifically bug 943846 and bug 936500
* everything I've worked on bar bug 936500 (which I haven't fixed yet) has hit central now I think, or at least inbound

Snorp:
* skia rebase
* try to fix gw280's issue with the single GLContext patch

kats:
* worked on scrollbars for b2g-gaia (bug 814435). have patches up, just need to figure out under what conditions to layerize to balance memory
* two interviews, meetings
* reviewed and tested botond's patch, seems there are still issues with it

botond:
* tested patch for bug 935219 (composition bounds calculation) a bit more
* ran into some b2g startup crashes and a crash in GLContext
* investigated bug 946833 (iframe becomes black when zoomed in)

BenWa:
* Landed APZC gesture detection fix
* Looked a bit at layerizing background-position
* Looking into homescreen perf, lost time because of js crashing the root b2g process. Found a work around. Working on the screenshot solution for now. May or may not move into retaining the layer tree

Nical:
* uploaded patch for review implementing the DrawTarget fallback (for the new D3D textures)
* further development of the new textures on windows is blocked on ContentClient locking being fixed
* if try is green and I get the patch r+ed we can land new textures for ImageLayers (off by default)
* landed the fallible allocation for MemoryTextureClient
* some reviews
* filed Bug 947194 (moz2Dify Image) -> this would let us avoid some very slow paths on windows with non-video ImageLayers

sotaro
* Continue new Texture at ContentHost/ContentClient on gonk. Some progress, but still have some problems.

bjacob
* Uploaded ready-for-landing version of PTexture patches, green on try, plan to land on gecko 29 train
* Discussed how to catch "Oops, we disabled gralloc again" with tests: abuse reftests with a pref to composite layers with artificial colors reflecting the TextureHost types

Jeff:
* conversation with Stephen on overscroll
* font containers, asking jkew for feedback on the api
* australis holly test failure - regions in jeopardy
