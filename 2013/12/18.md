Bug 946720 - Matt is blocked on this a bit, because he has some stuff.  We need the same kind of locking on Windows.


Kats:
* tuning APZC, right now painting is the bottleneck

Chris:
* performance, overdraw an issue with Peak
* 950488 - full screen mode after scrolling with white area at the bottom (probably display port badness)

Botond:
* off yesterday, sick
* scrolling of input fields, have a WIP patch

Sotaro, Peter, Dan:
* architecture discussion for texture client, ptexture
* discussion about what we're doing for 1.3, what Android does

BenWa:
* traceview is usable now
* profiling on flatfish returns gralloc errors - that are not there without profiling

Jeff:
* StretchRect driver problem is out in the wild - the driver badness is not a single range as we anticipated
* there may be an alternative eventually, tiling may actually fix it
* gallery app memory problems, we could solve many of them - the best one is to avoid the large temporary buffer when encoding
