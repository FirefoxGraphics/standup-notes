nical:
* added gtest for ycbcr texture
* added gtest for DataTextureSource (didn't submit yet because it turns out reading back the content of DataTextureSource is not implemented yet and that's used by the test)
* did some reviews for matt
* made PlanarYCbCrImage::Data forward-declarable and removed some #include dependencies
* trying to help matt find a quick way to fix bug 912907 (so far, attempt crashes on unagi)
* working on PTexture

BenWa:
* buffer rotation code is almost ready. Need to add an azure API to get the underlying surface bits. Looks like we will still support a fallback mode :(
* OMTC 10.6 decission time
* Looking into the intel power profiling patch posted from intel
* Want to look into layers building for b2g. Layer is being resized causing us to miss frames.
* Want to get a color layer for the background

* Summit: gfx session in Toronto (about 60 people), helped in mbest's games session
* http://people.mozilla.org/~bjacob/summit_gfx/
* Last Thursday: patch on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=914823 (ISurfaceAllocator dying too soon)
* Big patch queue of small WebGL patches
* WebGL security bug has patch - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=922921
* dev-platform chat -> filed WebGL compositing bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=924375
* Idea of what would be a general solution to IPDL actors dying too soon (worked with Sotaro on Thursday)
* Reference them with weak pointers
* When using them, convert the weak pointer to a strong pointer (Android::sp/wp idiom) to ensure atomicity. Problem: MFBT does not currently supports that - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=923554
* So IPDL actors need to be _both_ refcounted and SupportsWeakPtr
* Also need to split ISurfaceAllocator out of PLayerTransaction, because allocating surfaces should not depend on having layers.

Sotaro:
* Regressions around MP3 parsing - fixed some, working with media people that introduced these issues
* WebGL performance/sync problem, out of memory problem
* QC still has some fixes coming, but we're going to be facing OOM

Kats:
* mostly working on bug 920036 to route input events better on B2G, so that we can use APZC on the root process layers too
* also working on fixing a few rounding and unit conversion problems in APZC and writing unit tests for that code (bug 923431)
* need to follow up on some fennec things like bug 884047 and bug 911152

Bas:
* back from the summit - the graphics session was good, about 30 people wer there, good questions and discussion
