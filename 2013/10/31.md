* 902505 - scaling, finding more bugs and understand what's going on

Botond:
* APZC tests, related to the "wrong units" bug, writing a new test to really test what we need

* Thanks to Matt+Sotaro for pointing towards the real fix for bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=914823 - now have a 2-line patch that should really really work.
* Before I knew that, wrote patches that allow holding strong refs to ISurfaceAllocator; a prereq for that was that ClientLayerManager should no longer inherit from it. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=933082

Dan:
* Bug 830881 -            LayerScope backend
* Refactoring the work that vvuk did to make it work with new Compositor and TextureSources
