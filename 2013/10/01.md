BenWa:
* 765258: Solved. Need to find someone to own extending mozregression to use them (789112). It's not trivial because it's hard to get the push order
* Landed bug 920909
* Buffer unrotation working perfectly now but not fully optimized and is almost beating previous implementation already

Sotaro:
* gracefull fallback when out of pmem, but now running out of memory overall
* Nexus 4 MP4 problem - it's on all devices as well, but only on master, OK on 1.2

Jeff:
* resize profiling
* svg images slower than paths (layout being bad)
* consulting on unrotating

bjacob:
* enhancing "dump the gralloc buffer content"
* running out of pmem - most seems to be accounted for
* when doing WebGL, we should pass the flags so that we don't force gralloc
* graphite, molecular bonds, too complex for us to handle on 256mb
* angle issue

Bas:
* presentation for the summit, some confusion there
* Win 8 tablet - talked to Jim about it, there are bugs, perhaps some in the layer manager
* TART regression, paths patch, but we started drawing new stuff

James:
* Skia caching, patch on the beta, will talk to the Skia team today
* for canvas - looking ashmem with gralloc? can we use it for buffers with textures

George:
* Flash is broken with Skia rebase, so is shadow drawing
* preferable cache size trouble in debug

NRC:
* Windows OMTC patch
* * New texture host/client with thebes
* OMT CSS animation is waiting for review - tricky, perhaps too much for 1.2?  Perhaps get Mike Lee to profile this first?
