BenWa:
* Buffer unrotate - Trying bas' approach. It's 30% faster on desktop
* Helped maksimlin get the profiler working on x86 mobile
* get some data on the shader unification

kats:
* trying to/helping botond put together a patch to uplift from bug 904533 and friends to fix various fixed-position bugs on beta
* reviewed bug 904245 (fennec)
* worked on trying to figure out bug 919039 (koi+) and found bug 925902 which i have a patch for now

nical:
* WebGL OOM crash
* making progress on PTexture - still a memory leak, can't land it yet

Bas:
* With Seth on Moz2D'fication 
* with Markus on filters
* cubic Bezier arc length

sotaro:
*  mpeg4 seek problem. Temporary patch fixed the problem. Going to create a reviewable patch.
* 925940 - Black area is drawn during Contact app re-starting
* poppit upside down in some devices, but QA thinks unreproducible
* native window as an OpenGL context - will try to prototype this

Botond:
* 904533 - APZ panning on about:start tab is wonky considering for Beta, didn't fix all the bugs we were hoping it would
* studying the layer trees - difference in behaviour in Mac + Linux (regular content layer, vs. component alpha layer is created)
* will help Kats as appropriate

bjacob:
* benchmark to test unified shaders approach - already patches there
* stop the Android crashes
