Joe:
* pixman thread safe patch
* frame blending functions on raw pointers and pixman (both thread safe)
* blending class (to be used from multiple places)
* timing - compared to the raw pointers, in the context of a full operation, we are less than 0.5% slower, so nothing



BenWa
* GTest is now running on buildbot. There's a dependency problem that was introduced when applying a review comment. Patch is awaiting review
* 2 parts of hit testing completed: (1) ScrollInfoLayer, (2) Refactoring how APZC attach to layers
* Continuing



Guillaume:
* Fix 4 fails in WebGL conformance tests 1.0.2
* About 0.41% fail remaining on WebGL conformance tests currently
* Finish the 3dvision bug bisection



bjacob:
* support for MRT - Angle - Google - D3D9 not supporting for :texture0, feasible, but more work, so they didn't want to distract and would just do it on D3D11
* ES3 shader compiler in Angle - also in line behind D3D11 backend - we think we should base it on raw OGL shaders, so that we're not blocked starting (we're still blocked exposing it)
* SkiaGL



Nicolas:
* texture host/client, cleaning up todo's in the code, raw pointers vs. shmem issue
* didn't do the emscripten talks (yet), got unscheduled



Bas:
* D2D 1.1 backend. flush bug was flushing before clip, and we'd lose a draw call
* partial surface uploads refactored from D2D 1.0, so that we can use it (roughly) for 1.1
* main thing missing - radial gradients
