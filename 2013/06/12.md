* pixman is not quite thread safe, but it should be, and we can then use it for animated images compositing (over)
* cairo is not thread safe, Skia is thread safe (slower? perhaps not)

Joe:
* converting some of the animated images blending modes to be thread safe

Nicolas:
* tracking Moz2D-ify graphics code:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878673
* texture host/client
* shared GL texture instead of gralloc, which is blocked on camera app crashing
* contributor mentoring and help
* asked Bas and NRC to start reading the host/client patch to understand the intent

Guillaume:
* Testing WebGL conformance test 1.0.2 without and with the MRT patch to prevent regression problems after landing

BenWa:
* I got ScrollInfoLayer positionned correctly. In the process I had to disable TransformShadowTree so I need to fix that today

Jeff:
* mask surface (Quartz & D2D)

Bas:
* D2D 1.1 tests are passing
* fill glyphs related issues
* shadow implementation in Blur.cpp is faster than the old D2D, the one we used before.  we fall back when too large for an image
* stroking a thin curve performance is strange
* slashdot recording is good (modulo text not currently working)
* will start on the radial gradient

bjacob:
* SkiaGL meeting last night
* doing the changes to the ownership model
* too many reviews coming in these days (5+ day)

GLContext ownership in Moz2D, CanvasRenderingContext2D in the SkiaGL scenario.


Thebes and Moz2D and adding glue code (Nicolas)
* We have a lot of code that we use everywhere, thebes facilities
* it would be nice to have the equivalent Moz2D code so that we're not tempted to use the old one
* log paint as well
* all in all, cleaning up the tree of the Thebes, where applicable
* we still use Cairo on a lot of platforms, so we can't rely on having Moz2D
* we often use the data without processing it, so that may be a place to get into it - not the actual processing
* getAsDataSourceSurface() approach
* we're missing some utility code, helper functions
* will file a bug for it
* debate: in the case of GLContext - do we keep the Thebes version in place?  Yes, for now.

New mask surface api
* we need one way, we could add another
* don't like having two ways
* having two ways - one is specialized, it can be made faster, so that we can keep the general approach
* we do want to keep the general way, it'd be strange to remove it, especially if it's fast (e.g., without the intermediate surface)
* on the SVG side, we don't expose the API that SVG needs, we need to talk to SVG people about it, as converting SVG to Moz2D would be very difficult right now
* maybe we should expose the high level api, and closer to back ends we can figure out how to draw it, but unclear if that's possible
