Guillaume
* Vertex array object implementation, now building (now the most important WebGL 2 item to start, because it's spec'd out as a WebGL 1 extension)
* MRT patch landed

BenWa:
* (not me) OMTC on by default on Nightly
* SR&ED reviewed on PTO
* Getting Intel' patch power patch to work on mac. bug 769431
* GTest linking timer causing timeouts on build jobs

bjacob:
* SkiaGL, no need for the SourceSurfaceSkia patch, will be "works for me" until it shows up again
* Back to FontHost

Joe:
* SR&ED and more SR&ED

Bas:
* build system issues, to go with Win 7 SDK (seamonkey limitation)
* looking at the power usage - is tiling the answer?

Jeff:
* landed the last of the mask surface stuff - we should no longer be calling mask, we'll keep the old stuff for now
