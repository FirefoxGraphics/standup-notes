gw280:
- Fixed the last remaining winxp test failure, we're green again
- Investigated the reftest memory leak. Found it's due to our typeface cache, and bjacob's patch (which for some reason wasn't on the graphics branch) fixes that failure.
- Found a bunch of bugs in ScaledFontCairo with refcounting; will be working on fixing those shortly
- We seem to be intermittently crashing in SVG tests on Ubuntu. Need to investigate whether this is due to our patches or someone else



Guillaume:
* OES_vertex_array_object landed (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=738869)

bjacob:
* landing the patches
* mentored bug
* SkiaGL issues with George & James (memory usage, multiplexing)
* multiplexing has some extra work because of our GL context class does "other" stuff
* font memory leak with George

Jeff:
* enabling others to do their work

Joe:
* image animation patches up for review (failing try)

Bas:
* gl context multiplexing for nv path rendering, now 25x slower 
* Nvidia has their work cut out for them
