Jeff:
* native context, seems to be ok so far
* planning to test next
* ringing in jpeg

Joe:
* fixed a security bug
* fixing a top-crash
* trying to reproduce another ASAN security bug (no luck so far, will continue)

BenWa:
* APZC meetings and coding
* Reviewed Anton Multi-threaded cleopatra changes, looking good
* More tweaks to dual linking today

Guillaume:
* webgl context changes, working on the patches
* 3d thumbnails
* warnings patch on m-c

bjacob:
* finished the poc attack, cross origin images (FE-Composite, with a constant factor)

Nicolas:
* texture host/client
* gralloc, lifetime issues

Bas:
* separate sim from main rendering in player2d - pushed and works now
* unit tests not all passing, figuring out how to best fix it, keeping performance in mind
* we take some shortcuts in the D2D backend, doing things differently gives big improvement

SkiaGL:
* after rebrebasing now, we want to stay closer to the latest

Jeff on native context access
* cairo and quartz will want to expose native draw context to consumers (widgets, most likely)
* static function that takes a type check and return a stack class that contains a CG context (if draw type was CG), the caller can check for success, use it, caller has to return the context before the stack object expires
* the stack class makes it more difficult to forget to return it and take care of it
* can't hold on to it extended amount of time
* perhaps "borrow cg context" naming, explicitly going out of scope releases it
* we want an explicit "return", rather than implicit

linux make current really slow
* even with get current check, we have to do a lot of make current calls
* we don't know what the problem is, but the performance is really bad
* some of the make currents are more expensive than others
* is non-trivial webgl also showing make current - will test by doing glfinish just before make current and see what that timing looks like
* OMTC with WebGL still on main thread is what we want
* the underlying device pipeline is hidden in OpenGL, has to synchronize in the background
* one call per frame - the driver should be able to take care of this, so what is going on?
