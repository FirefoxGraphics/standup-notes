Bas:
* nv path, good progress, working on windows, rendering slashdot, 50x slower than Skia or Cairo
* working on multiplexing context creation
* not quite sure where the cost is right now
* they're going to keep driving this
* it's unlikely we'd be able to do this on existing drivers, we're finding driver bugs

Jeff:
* misc random stuff
* IE11 running, checking out how webgl works
* ANGLE will multiplex D3D context

bjacob:
* DOS'ed IE11, with the updated test case
* started looking at one of the OpenGL SkiaGL problem (reading back pixels) - same issue JGilbert fixed a while ago (BGRA, or RGBA2BGRA conversion)
* attempted to debug an OOM tbpl on Android, gave up on printf
* big performance impact to create GL context, multiplexing is the way to go (one GL context, multiple render buffers)
* ANGLE round of reviews

Joe:
* refactoring in the code for the image animation

Guillaume:
* patch for OES_vertex_array_object pass all conformance test, any regressions with WebGL conformance tests 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, Push To Try completly green. Ready for review.
* Found a bug in the OES_vertex_array_object, I have reported on the public mailing list

Nical:
* doing reviews
* updated gfx related wiki pages

BenWa:
* Landed fix for multi-threaded profiling memory regressions
* Going to increase the timeout for make check
* interview
* APZC patch seems to trigger a corruption issue but valgrind doesn't work on 10.8
