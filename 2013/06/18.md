Bas:
* radial gradient rendering
* helping find a bug in nrc's D3D9 layers implementation

Nicolas:
* problems with a fennec build, errors in JS code
* layer border dev tool thing

Timothy:
* synced image decoding and ref tests, so that we can land the fix for the scrolling jank

bjacob:
* Skia bugs
* valgrind on the canvas tests - all the leaks are related to FontHost - will work on this next

Joe:
* patch for factoring out frame blending, reviewed, but there is another review blocking this
* need a tool to specify animated gif attributes

Guillaume:
* published a patch on bugzilla about fixing the max value reachable by MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS, and fixing a conformance test about creating a canvas with bigger dimensions that MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS
* published a patch on bugzilla to seperate the offscreen opengl context in 2 functions calls instead of 1 : to be able to have a valide OpenGL context to get drivers constants before creating the main framebuffer
* but just have a regression detected by try commit : on Mac OS 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8  on a webgl conformance tests that I can't reproduce myself yet.

BenWa:
* interview
* Hit testing passing my simple tests with several APZC. Will add tests for hit testing with 3d transformed layers
* Improved the marker UI in cleopatra
* Tactical discussion: Investing in layer building, adding optional layers that can be speed up by specific (hardware) compositor.

Jeff:
* landed mask surface
* performance difference - for large images 3x faster
* today - api changes if the special case can use mask surface, instead of extend none
* this lets us avoid calling general Azure mask
