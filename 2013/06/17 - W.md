To mention next week
* Direct2D "off" automated testing for Metro
* Some unexplained Moz2D performance problems with D3D11, so going back to "old" way, which performs about the same (much simpler code).
* GTest is now on buildbot
* Clearing up WebGL 1.0.2 conformance tests

________________


Jeff:
* today, if the reviews are in, try and land the mask surface

Bas:
* effects system, radial gradient next
* factored out large surface code, really large surfaces

Nicolas:
* helping the new contributor
* with dev tools integrating layer border display (flag to do it per layer)
* paint flashing is already in dev tools
* this is only available with OMTC

Joe:
* blend object compiling, should be thread safe
* today, continue, try to land

bjacob:
* memory leaks
* Skia
* working on the graphics branch, the ownership is landed there

Guillaume:
* A bug on WebGL conformance 1.0.2 about drawing buffer : WebGL specifications authorises canvas larger than MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS, by clamping drawing area in the canvas if needed.
* Found a WebGL crash when creating a canvas on maximum size reachable by MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS (resolution of 16k x 16k) : we should add a maximum value reachable by MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS like chrome did (~4096)
* Found a ticket about those two problems, and someone has be assigned Jan 28th. Therefore trying to be assigned on this ticket
* Start the bisection of the second 3dvision bug
* Cloning https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/larch/

BenWa:
* Progressing on hit testing + writing tests
* Working on more Cleopatra improvements for multi-thread profiling
