Bas:
* rendering directly to the surface, the "old" way, 1-2% slower than before, but doesn't really matter, while we're trying to figure out why the correct approach is 2x slower
* all the other performance numbers are similar
* now moving to shadows, large surfaces
* radial gradients (canvas spec) - custom effects, could be challenging
* cleaner code, not running faster (yet?)

Nicolas:
* texture host/client
* gralloc story is still confusing
* camera is (as usual) causing trouble
* office grand opening (emscripten talk)

BenWa:
* GTest revisions got r+.
* Progressing on finding why the scrollable placeholder layers are empty

Guillaume:
* Implementing and testing WEBGL_draw_buffers
* Bug found and fixed in the same patch in the webgl function checkFramebufferStatus with  GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MISSING_ATTACHMENT specifications

bjacob:
* SkiaGL
* CanvasRenderingContext2D, ownership of GLContext, Skia, etc.
* http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2511482

Jeff:
* include cleanup, profiled compilation, 50% in parsing
* 368 generated files, take 3s each, is there a way to combine them and speed things up? will it save wallclock and cpu time?

Joe:
* different designs for image animation (OMT), picked one
* will start implementing
