For the report:
* New intern, Guillaume Abade
* Starting to lean on the GfxInfo reworking
* Some regressions with 3D Vision (videos, images, silverlight. seemingly separate issues)
* In progress: Moz2D core graphics (Azure Quartz), OMT image animation, SkiaGL, 

________________


BenWa:
* More progress on reusing code for building scrollable layer. Everything looks fine except the visible region which gets lost before it makes it to the shadow layers.
* Made a proof of concept for a security bug

Jeff:
* masking in Quartz backend, looking at a different interface (mask surface api)
* question: do we need to (longterm) maintain the old mask surface api? discussion to be had in the weekly?

Bas:
* D2D 1.1
* OOM on 2k +, have to sort this out before progressing further

Guillaume:
* OES_texture_float and OES_texture_float_linear finally done
* WEBGL_draw_buffers is working but few comformance tests failed and few conformance tests seam to be bugged.

Nical:
* Texture stuff: gralloc mostly
* feedbacks from FFOS hackaton
* new contributor (or soon to be): abhishekworld@gmail.com (interested in contributing in gfx, never touched gecko yet)

bjacob:
* understand current SkiaGL crash, that was blocking memory leak hunting; consulting with the original authors; will have a patch later today
* with Guillaume, with Matt W. (frame aborts)
* reviews

Joe:
* security patches
* now figuring out how to best separate compositing of (animated) image frames into a thread agnostic class; design continues
