Joe:
* PTO

Nicolas:
* on a train

bjacob:
* B2G layers refactor (bug 834916)
* worked with jrmuizel
* finally made real progress: we're rebooting because gaia JS code tells us to! Trying to figure why now.
* Linux Intel driver sec-crit (bug 827106):
* fix landed on m-c, approval requested for beta and aurora (but likely to be turned down for beta --- too big)for ESR17, made a patch to blacklist Mesa altogether like it was on ESR10 (bug 838413)
* Talked with Mike Hoye about mentored bugs
* Mike is a long-time Mozilla toronto community member and just joined as engineering community manager. He's awesome. You should say hello to him. He is interested in whatever we've been doing to help the community.

BenWa:
* Still working on bug 823236

Bas:
* no layers refactoring work, under the weather
* the standalone Azure build may get you some interesting mismatched include files
* PDF.js just uses a lot of memory, crashes in graphics because we're trying to allocate memory there, but not a graphics issue

Timothy:
* owner discard .html (Josh M.) still orange, and it takes a day to get results, and not reproducible locally
* will disable the test, land the code, then try push a day to get this non-orange
* crash in Skia resizer, tracking in assembly

Jeff:
* ditto bjacob, paired up

George:
* SkiaGL with Taiwan
