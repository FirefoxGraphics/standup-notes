Is somebody asking releng to start graphics branch builds? 835667
How are the try runs? Ref tests?  Should we run them "all the time" now? - Going to do one today. Not yet.
Should we start the patch breakdown, reviews? - Soon, perhaps next week.


nrc:
* Android regressions (you may as well leave this here, it'll save me time every single day :-( )
* Test and fix WebGL on Android
* Test new ContentClient stuff on Linux, Android

bjacob:
* gralloc success, with Jeff's help, should have patches today

Jeff:
* with bjacob on the gralloc stuff
* a bit of a look at the region code - there may be badness in there we didn't anticipate
* android flickering (low & high res tiles)

Nicolas:
* async video
* chasing a bug related to the window focus change (blinking blank frame)
* March 30th weekend - community events

Bas:
* host direct work - reftests @60% and going strong.  should be fewer failures

Timothy:
* follow up to images functionality landed
* plug-ins visibility regressions
* panel positioning, B2G bug

Joe:
* 3x faster with MT image decoding (90s->30s)

* if all clean, restart the greening

BenWa:
* "pre-fetch/decode image"
* channels are closing properly now, might add an assert
* new shmem asserts with OMTC now
