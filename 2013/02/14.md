* Some reviews with jrmuizel on streaming buffers (webgl)
* Some progress on b2g layers. pushed 2 small fixes, more work to do; currently it displays some stuff but still doesn't go through the gralloc path as it's supposed to.
* https://etherpad.mozilla.org/i-dont-understand-the-new-layers-code
* Looked at DRM proposal.

BenWa:
* Landed some patches to count ctor/dtor to look for leaks. We indead do leak on shutdown but it doesn't look like anything catathrosphic
* Working on syncing up multi-threaded profiles

Bas:
* intermediate surfaces done
* blending issues done
* next (last) on the plate, masking layers

Nicolas:
* ran into ipdl bug, uploaded a patch for the ipdl compiler, blocking async video
* now continuing with async video

Joe:
* security bug fixed, record & replay works - with breakpoints in the right spot
* a few oranges left



Jeff:
* Android test failure fixed (have Nicolas review, because the merge caused this)
* streaming buffers bounced
* gradient stuff with Avi, almost done, mostly (only) impacts D2D.  we now hit the cache a lot more on window resizes, tab animation
