Joe (at a doctor's appointment)
* frustrated by being unable to push to try
* applied review comments from seth
* wrote a new patch for the next step towards OMTIA - sharing frames between frame blenders

Bas:
* Taught Chris some of the tricks with HG for getting his stuff on Moz2D.
* Still fighting the build system
* Got some tips and tricks from MattN for premature recording terminations
* Some preparations for leaving tomorrow night for San Francisco.

Nicolas:
* reinstalling linux
* need to test D3D texture work, should just work

George:
* landed Skia rebase, preffed off for SkiaGL
* shadow stuff with Matt

Guillaume:
* starting WebGL 2 and provide a wiki about it https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Gabadie/WebGL2 (not finished yet, parralize while eavy compilation time)
* had a meeting with Benoit J. and Jeff G. about disigning the WebGL 2 implementation :
* We decided to rename the context WebGLContext to WebGLContextBase, and create 2 children : WebGLContext1 and WebGLContext2

Matt:
* regressions from OMTC

Jeff:
* WebGL crash with OMTC - use IO surfaces (what Mac does with core animation), it is cross thread compositing, so more likely to work
* we'll also use IO surfaces (if we do accelerated CG canvas for that), for plug-ins and E10S
