Matt's performance improvement - ~15fps to ~50fps on http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/Bubbles/
Landed Moz2D on OSX.  This is a long march getting shorter to kicking Thebes out.
OMTC on the Mac - will turn off

Guillaume:
* Have finished query objects
* Have just found a regression on WebGL 1.0.2 conformance tests this morning after repository update

George:
* Disabled Skia on all big-endian (white listed x86 amd64 instead), started looking at the skpath inf recursion, following up

Nicolas:
* bringing back in the removed classes: having these classes along the new ones isn't straight forward, will take a few days to write all the code
* will put behind a pref, enable fennec
* image stuff for B2G will take a while; will land behind a pref
* for reviews - all reviewers will need to understand TextureHost/Client, but the rest can be split

Bas:
* with Adobe on filters API for Moz2D; on a branch.  D2D 1.1 for half of them, Marcus on software (moving out of SVG code)
* GL/OMTC implementation comes later
* Marcus is 1/2 way through, we have standalone unit tests

BenWa:
* Worked on a mobile crash with to many layers. Have a patch to restrict to 20 layers. Better memory usage and scrolling performance at the cost of painting time. Need to make sure we handle 3D transforms
* Working on exposing the profiler unwinder infrastructure to general gecko and getting them into markers
* Discussion: AZC on desktop (OSX)?

Matt:
* Moz2D Core graphics bugs
* gradients - not supported by core graphics

Jeff:
* Moz2D core graphics bugs
* gradiants - not supported by core graphics

Joe:
* don't want to store images in shared memory until texture host/client lands
* will follow up afterwards
* communicating image animation frames to the compositor
