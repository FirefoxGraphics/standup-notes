gw280:
* nvestigated why flash crashes on android since landing the skia rebase; it's due to the new cairo fonthost which only allows for an SkTypeface to be created by wrapping an existing cairo_font_face_t, rather than allowing us to create an SkTypeface from a file or stream data or pattern. 
* Spent yesterday looking at the cairo APIs for fonts and gfxFont to determine the best way to solve this issue. Current line of thinking is to implement CreateTypeface* methods on SkFontHost_cairo to call into cairo's freetype font API, then wrap the SkTypeface object around that.

Nicolas:
* rebasing the host/client, some new crashes
* software backend hasn't been ported yet
* landed the preliminary renaming/easy stuff

Jeff:
* reftests failures on CG Moz2D, so far bugs in the code
* no interesting failures yet
* will land this behind the pref, we need it

Joe:
* will be landing stuff today

Guillaume:
* Working on creating OpenGL 3 context and upper, but on Mac OS X, we can only create an 3.2 core profile (or 4.3 on OS X 10.9), and current GFX shaders are not compatible with. Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=891204 created for that issue.
* Asked Jonathan to get 10.9 for me, to have access to sample objects that gonna be needed by WebGL 2

Matt:
* IO surface bugs

BenWa:
* APZC, landed hit testing
