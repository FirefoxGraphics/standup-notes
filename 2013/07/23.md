George:
* managed to reproduce the intermittent crash reliably and I don't think it's my bug. Am going to spend a little more time to make sure then stop wasting my time on it. 
* spent yesterday fighting with the armv6 build. Turns out on linux64 you need to use ndk r8e and GCC 4.6 instead of 4.7 to have a successful build.

Matt:
* E10S, teaching them how to do things

Joe:
* ipdl, some issues that need to be resolved

Jeff:
* Moz2D CG is still in there - we do need to do non-OMTC Moz2D CG
* text behaviour changed, related to this, a blocker
* B2G - still a disaster on invalidation
* how can we measure scrolling performance on B2G

Nicolas:
* gralloc, uploaded for review

* Vertex array object security buf fixed, re-enabled and landed
