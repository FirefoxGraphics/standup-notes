Bas:
* recording for the filters
* performance analysis on the warp (four cores, hyperthreading no difference)
* single threaded, not that good, probably don't want it
* multi-threaded, uses a lot of cpu, on a lot of cores
* solid color rectangles - 50% slower than skia/cairo
* surface creation - ok, actually faster
* radial gradients - 10x faster than skia, 22x faster than cairo
* compared to accelerated, about as fast
* unscaled and aligned even faster than discrete graphics (laptop)
* masking faster (2x), shadows slower

George:
* apitrace on android (security bug, upstream uses properties, segfault on launch, not catching in gdb)
* whitelisting extensions to expose to skia

Nicolas:
* video regression fixed
* layer borders look fine now
* fennec mochitest failures with new texture stuff

Jeff:
* regions

Matt:
* B2G problems
* reviews done

bjacob:
* SkiaGL b2g
* debug tests are not easy
* passing the tests locally on hamachi is an issue
* compositor issues not caught by mochitests

Joe:
* review to implement image protocol
