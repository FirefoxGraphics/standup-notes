Texture host/client patch https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=858914 - let's talk about it
________________
 Currently, host & client don't match one shared buffer. Hard to match the lifetimes of the buffers, either with gralloc, double buffering, switching tabs (compositor change), etc.

With the change, every TextureClient/TextureHost have one shared buffer through their lifetime, and don't see other buffers at all.  There will only be one SurfaceDescriptor being passed.  A new buffer will need a new texture client and a new matching texture host.
Double buffering is not done in TC/TH, the compositable will use two TC/TH instead.  Buffering is handled by the client, rather than the host now, the intelligence is with the client.
Sync - the shared data is there when TC/TH are created - "AddTexture" shares the SurfaceDescriptor (SD).  We don't see SD anymore after that, we tell TC about the update, which sends a message to TH, which then uploads, etc.
Only implemented for ImageLayers (async video, all the texture formats we have are covered anyway).  Only doing the ImageClient code.  Since this was a rewrite, the TextureHost was also sanitized.  Before it inherited from TextureSource, now we have separate objects.  Makes it easier to share code - TCShmem and THShmem, THMemory are back end independent.  "DataTextureSource" is from Vlad's patch (not landed yet) and the only thing that needs to be updated.
YCbCr client/host classes will be gone now.  Shmem is "smart enough" to handle those scenarios now.
GrallocBufferActor is gone.
How's "content client incremental" (CCI) going to work?  It sends a new SurfaceDescriptor every time, which only sends the part that changed. You would need to create and destroy new TextureClient/TH every time. Video frames do it. Does it need to be the same TH every time?  For CCI, yes it does - except, it would have to receive TH, not the region. This is used for all thebes layers on OSX.
