Who is talking to Jeff Gilbert about his part? - Milan should check in with Jeff
Who is tracking Nick & Matt?
Makefile changes (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=784841), how does that impact us?
Pan/zoom - Anthony Jones & Kats - raise your hand if you want to be involved
Documentation in the background, start thinking about this as we're doing things:
* FOSDEM talks
* OMT image decoding
* other things



Jan 30


Bas:
* refactoring - look for things that break in OGL
* will send an e-mail to dev platform about our work
* suggestion to duplicate some code temporarily for non-OMTC layer managers



BenWa:
* Focused on subpixel case for bug 826422
* Intel power meeting
* Invalid drawable patch is ready, will land today



Nicolas:
* merging, pushed on the graphics branch
* worried about the number of things in GL layers and how much HG misses; we want to land this fast, as we're missing a lot of things potentially
* non-omtc OGL was broken a few weeks ago on Linux
* FOSDEM preparation



Timothy:
* crashers, skia on linux (PGO)
* crasher in layout



bjacob:
* fixed a b2g IPC bug exposed by the layers refactoring (835920)
* still not booting
* looked again at Android h264 blacklisting for bug 802827 and friends: main blocklist set (824118) waiting on QA, worked with them a bit; another blocklist set requested
* talked with "a certain games partner" (this etherpad is public) about WebGL success rates. Having relaxed the blacklist recently was good for us. We should consider doing it again in early 22 cycle.
* Received SuperPad III tablet with imapx200 chipset --- looked into setting it up for debug (OpenGL ES2 context creation failure: bug 771774)



Jeff:
* we run on Android, a bit messy with tiling - memory leaks (Bas suggestion that allocation of effects could be a cause)



Joe:
* OMT image decoding
