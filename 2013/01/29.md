BenWa
* Analyzed shutdown profile
* bug 833087: Finish patch and tested
* bug 815602: Found cause of invalid drawable
* bug 826422: Updated patch and tested with D2D
* bug 835592: Missing attachment 671154 from uplift



Jeff:
* android builds on the graphics branch, landing some of this stuff on central to make it easier to merge later

bjacob:
* B2G builds on the graphics branch now; crashes with an assertion on boot, aiming to have it boot today
* large textures topcrasher on B2G now backported

Joe:
* OMT image decoding, unload blocking issue
* working out how to expose frames to non-animated image decoders, without asking
* chrome fuzzer caught the same crash, so the refactoring just exposed a crash, not caused it

George:
* SkiaGL canvas rendering on Android, with separate GL context

Bas:
* FOSDEM presentation
* D3D11

Nicolas:
* FOSDEM presentation
* merging the central, found a way to do it without breaking non-OMTC code
* we will have to manually review the GL layers, not convinced HG is automaticlally doing the right job (well it does, but new gl layers features must be ported to compsite layers)
* Fennec bug 823236 - no time, somebody else will cover it (assigned to BenWa anyway)

Timothy:
* fixing the test before can land
