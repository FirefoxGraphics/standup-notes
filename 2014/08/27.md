George:
* Jeff's accurate blending patch, to talk to Skia how to do it
* :snorp's Android plug-ins patch issues

Bas:
* OMTC bugs, remaining are blacklisting
* D2D1.1 integration; buffer rotation is not quite right

Jeff:
* landed the windows shadows omtc fix, stuck
* removing some fuzzing looked like it made the results no worse, but now it seems to pass even without the latest change
* skia reftest failure

kats:
* mostly working on bug 1055760, got final patches up for review, and addressed review comments so far. filed some follow-ups as well
* landed the patch to fix some of the broken %f printing call sites, bug 1057642
* reviewed kip's patch for APZ smooth scrolling, bug 1022825 and roc's patches on multi-layer-apz
* helping peter with the selection bubbles show/hide on APZ transform, bug 1020801
* will look at bug 1058664 today while waiting for multi-layer-apz reviews

botond:
* bug 965022 (compiler errors for wrong printf-like function usage)
* fixed OS X failures for AppendPrintf patches
* landed printf_stderr and AppendPrintf patches, got backed out for mochitest failures
* wrote patch to convert nsPrintfCString uses; some OS X failures left to fix
* reviewing bug 1055760 (multi-FrameMetrics)
* prepared build of uniform stretch overscroll effect (bug 1057578) for UX

Nical:
* Landed the ~ISurfaceAllocator fix
* Worked on the X BadDrawable crash (very easy to trigger with OMTC Linux)
* turns out we are destroying the window's drawable in ~nsWindow before destroying most of the OMTC stuff (textures, etc.) so when we get to destroying the textures, we fail to xMakeCurrent because the drawable is dead. Not sure what the best solution is but it is certainly not making sure that the textures are destroyed by the end of ~nsWindow (have tried to do that for maybe 2 years now)

sotaro
* Invstigated invalid fd problem
* TabChild::DestroyWindow() did invalid fd close.
* The problem happened when the DestroyWindow was called twice.
* khuey created a patch for it. It seems to work.

BenWa:
* Still trying to understand how the visible region for layers is calculated. Emulator is slow
* Wrote a patch to add ToString methods to rect / region / matrix.
* Reviews for matt' tiling fixes

Walter:
* Skia patch, a few more smaller ones
* Windows XP/Windows Server 2008 issue
* OS X copyTexImage2D issue, works fine with native application

Jeff G.:
* under the weather, can't re-land some of the stuff that is in the office
* cache2 emergency last week, got the fix sorted out - an intermittent really went full crash
* Jukka's testing, one of the apps saw improvement, but not the partner one; also, his compositor is maxed at 37fps, though we have the improvement - we should land this, then go to Bacon

Dan:
* with Jeff G - see above
* profiling tools on windows, tracing providers, some of our profiler slows things too much (e.g., 6ms)
* haven't seen anything conclusive on Jukka's examples
* saw some sleeps with desktop window manager (are we serializing the compositor in the end because we're waiting for vsync at the wrong time?)

mchang:
* Getting mwu to review both 970751 and 987527 this week to land by Friday.
* Integrating layer frame uniformity info into cleopatra (bug 1049258).

Jerry:
* v-sync design review (wiki), some discussion ongoing
* some errors on try server with the full patch
