Bas:
* D2D1.1
* partial uploading regression from a recent patch, (we're missing SW+accelerated composition performance tests)

BenWa:
* Discussed profiling and symbolication with b2g-automation for reference devices OTA builds
* Tweaked and landed the visual indicator
* Progress on compositor query. Wrote a platform overdraw test (95%-200%)
* Turns out we already have a way to test if an element is OMTAing a property
* Put up a patch to move cpp_eclipse project outside of the workspace (common error)
* Put up a patch to import the cpp_eclipse project when generated by disabling the indexer

Matt
* Tiling for OSX 10.8 passing tests and performing well, ready to land once I get reviews
* 10.6 is still lagging performance wise, will investigate further once 10.8 lands

kats:
* spent far too long on bug 1058664 but finally got it figured out; discovered i was wrong twice in the process. anyway got the fix landed (thanks botond)
* reviewed kip's smooth scrolling patch
* reviewing mason's touch interpolation patch

botond:
  - wrapping up printf issues
          - landed the non-problematic part (printf_stderr) of bug 965022
          - will leave the rest (AppendPrintf, affected by NSPR issue) for later
          - for bug 1057642 (coordinate printing footgun)
             - landed ToString patch
             - backed out part of strongly typed coordinates patch to remove footgun
  - bug 1058884 (follow-up to multi-layer-apz to update some compositor code)
          - some discussions with Kats, and BenWa, began working on patch
  - more discussion with Kats about coordinate systems
  - trying to get Fennec build in order in preparation for looking into bug 1024872 (regression in layout code causing Fennec problems)



Nical:
* Turns out blobber doesn't work in case of test timeout (the harness is killed without uploading the data), filed a bug against mozharness
* BadPixmap (basic): waiting for try results with XSync to see if anything interesting shows up
* BadPixmap (gl): patch up for review
* landed the part of Chris Lord's patch in bug 994541 that lets you use OMTC on linux without gl layers (OMTC still preffed off)

mchang:
* Multiple reviews on touch interpolation 970751 and manual testing
* Make it easier to get frame uniformity data 1049258 - Have WIP for both cleopatra front end and fetching data from Gecko
* Found a calendar regression (1060006) while testing 970751. Will probably become a blocker.

sotaro
* HERE map consume more than 80MB kgsl memory bug
* When canvas is not shown, canvas layer is hidden. when there is no canvas layer, no one calls glFlush() for GLContext. It causes kgsl memory grow.
* How to call glFlush() when the canvas layer does not exist is a problem.
