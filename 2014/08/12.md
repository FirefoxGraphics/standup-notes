* Looking at touch interpolation algorithms to optimize for smoothness.
* Adding support for touch interpolation across multiple fingers

kats:
* landed patches in bug 1051985 to move a bunch of stuff from ContainerLayer to Layer
* helped khuey debug and track down cause of bug 1047639, got that landed
* found some issues with how we deal with CSS transforms in APZ code (e.g. bug 1052474). These will probably need fixing before we can do multi-layer-apz

botond:
  - bug 1050789 (stuck-in-overscroll when toggling overflow-y)
         - mysterious changing font size was indeed due to font inflation; fixed by adding meta-viewport tag
         - ran into hard-to-repro APZ assertion, filed bug 1052023; will try to repro and get some logs from it
         - actual issue turned out to be a duplicate of bug 1041471 (Miller was using a several-week-old Gecko)
  - bug 1052121 (another stuck-in-overscroll issue)
         - discovered while testing bug 1050789 in the Browser app where you can zoom it
         - fix is simple, but the locking is tricky
         - will wait until bug 1039992 (overscroll handoff chain lifetimes refactoring) simplifies things
  - bug 927946 [adding APZ prefs to all.js] (mentored bug)
         - talked to contributor on IRC, reviewed patch
  - went over some of the named-args feedback with Ehsan
  - some reviews
  - bug 923512 (strongly-typed coordinates)
         - fixed patch is waiting for Bas' review
