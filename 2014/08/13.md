BenWa:
* QA performed a bisection of the overdraw problem:
* 1) regression on trunk only because of the visibility patch
* 2) We have a patch on trunk to get better overdraw, not 2.0 but I don't think it blocks
* 3) Difference between camera's video and picture mode

sotaro
* Investigate ion map failure bug
* b2g process seems to close invalid fd
* One place doing it is RemoteOpenFileParent::OpenSendCloseDelete()
* I am going to fix it and investigate other place to close invalid fd
