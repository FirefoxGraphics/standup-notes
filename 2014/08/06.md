Bas:
* OMTC triage, looks like we're getting most of the issues, but some new reports
* will check what happens with D2D1.1

kats:
* mostly working on apz-fennec (bug 1046344 and bug 1049136)
* started looking into bug 1042959. can repro intermittently

botond:
* bug 1040087 (overscroll flicker with scrollgrab)
* debugged to investigate cause: it's a (legitimate) compositor optimization that is sometimes triggered
* proper fix is to not mislead the compositor about opacity of an overscrolled layer
* bug 1042974 (scrollgrab elements cannot be flung)
* wrote a patch that attempts to fix it
* ran into issue about overscroll handoff chain lifetimes
* bug 923512 (strongly-typed coordinates) waiting on Bas' review

Nical
* re-landed most of the stuff that I tried to land yesterday, pushed the rest to try
* reviews
* feeling sick today

BenWa:
* Worked with devtools on the timeline tool.
* Discussions with gaia about performance problems
* Discussions with layout about CSS performance

sotaro
* catch up
* Did feedbacks to some media and widget gonk bugs

jrmuizel:
* tried to get my local build working
* wrote some more to skia people to try to finish convincing them to take my rounding changes

* bug 987527 - hwc hw vsync event

Mason
* bug 970751 - Remove UserInputData from nsAppShell and translate notifyMotion -> MultiTouch. Going through review / feedback

Dan:
* WebGL2, bugs created, separating into reviewable patches
* Also a bunch of code got moved, so things needed to be heavily re-based
* Will start landing piecemeal - do we need a pref specific to WebGL2?

Jeff:
* Tracking down misc. things:
* rendering issue in one of the windows performance test (some part of this was backed out)
* close to landing the fallback from webgl content creation failure
* looking at the feedback from the design reviews
* shared pointers work (UniquePtr helps); will probably do a follow up blog
