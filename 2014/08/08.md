botond (PTO this morning):
  - landed bug 1040087 (overscroll flicker with scrollgrab)
  - bug 923512 (strongly-typed coordinates)
         - debugged mochitest failures locally on Windows
         - cause: the result of a 'float / int' was being truncated to 'int', e.g. 50 / 100 --> 0
         - fixed, posted updated patch for re-review by Bas
  - bug 1037066 (delay before :active state)
         - investigated cause and possible platform solutions
         - discussed with Kats and Doug; Kats suggested generating a touch-move immediately after a touch-start
         - documented our findings and suggested solution on the bug
  - bug 1042974 (scrollgrab elements cannot be flung)
         - more work on overscroll handoff chain lifetime refactoring
