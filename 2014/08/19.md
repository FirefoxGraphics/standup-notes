* Reviewed WebGL frame delay patch

kats:
* addressed some review comments by botond on bug 1052063
* more discussion with roc on multi-layer-apz, looks like we will have multiple framemetrics per layer
* landed a fix for a recent crash regression, bug 1055532
* put up a couple of patches to fix clicking in apz-fennec, bug 1055548
* updated the patch on bug 1049887 to fix the scissor rect in apz-fennec

botond:
* bug 1039992 (overscroll handoff chain lifetimes)

* Investigating HERE Maps app oom problem.

DanG:
* Investigated why WebGL content wasn't displaying, as reported by Jeff M in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912196
* ANGLE only uses BGR format buffers. We created RGB format. This leads to a failure in glBlitFramebuffer called in GLScreenBuffer::AssureBlitted().

jgilbert:
* Iterated on marking failures for single-mochitest-per-webgl-test
* SurfStream throughput hack:
* Green on Try.
* New patches coming to fix review questions.
* Will need testing to check perf impact. (minimal perf impact for my machine)
* Checking Try results for context-creation-fallback, since I'm still getting ANGLE asserts for large textures.
* More investigation into Android+Flash crashes (no insights yet)
