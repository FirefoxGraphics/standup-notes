Nical:
* Bug 1048099 - Looks like this happens when a D3D9 device is lost: the CompositorD3D9 doesn't handle it. one solution could be to always use the gfxWindowPlatform's device manager since gfxWindowPlatform is notified when the device is lost and recreates a device manager accordingly. There might be thread safety problems, though (not sure). Or have CompositorD3D9 be notified (also need to be careful about threads and also ref cycles).
* Bug 1047765 - patch up for review
* rebased the DrawTargetTiled integration, addressing review comments.
