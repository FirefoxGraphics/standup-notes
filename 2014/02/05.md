gw280:
* Found out a workaround for b2g builds spiking my load average to 17 and causing my computer to be unusable
* Still debugging the tbpl/b2g issue. Had a few hunches, didn't work out, now trying to set up a debugging environment for GL on B2G. Lots of fun.

bjacob:
* Faulty: made children live longer so they get more chances to annoy the parent
* Made asserts not fatal in children
* Made parents not kill naughty children
* With that, filed many more bugs (now at 31)
* All is on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=963790
* I think I'm done with this first round of exploration --- the pace of new bug discovery is slowing down, and I'm out of tricks to make Faulty more effective.
* Next: categorizing these bugs

botond;
* reviewed/feedbacked a few "parachute knitting" patches
* tested Timothy's new patch for bug 962791 (Cancel button hiding) - working, bug has relanded
* tested Doug's mega-patch for checkerboarding and gave feedback
* bug 964517 (text overlapping in AccuWeather app)
* managed to play back moz 2d recording, but it did not have some relevant information (text drawing commands are not recorded on b2g)
* doing some debugging to discriminate between wrong thing being painted or buffer rotation bug
* IRC discussion about dynamic toolbar design in 1.4

kats:
* looked into vlad's "never ending painting" bug 967335, but was unable to repro
* looked into the keyboard not showing (bug 963584) - seems to be a lower-level issue, handed off to mwu
* got an r- for a patch on bug 963278, redid it, will re-request review on the new version
* looked a bit more into the wikipedia bug 965593 but it's a layout issue, so handed off to tn
* going to get back to bug 963852 (missing scrollbars) today

Bas:
* Moz2D update from central, debug builds not working
* D3D10 new textures (have regressions)

Nicolas:
* removing some deprecated GL code
* some component alpha problems still remaining (Linux OMTC), working on a patch
* D3D11 and D3D9 try test failures

Chris:
* no checkerboarding patch on inbound
* playing with displayport heuristics once no-checkerboarding is on
* reworked the plan for tiles and new texture client, off to Bas and Nicolas for now

Jeff:
* AWS reftests - really slow - python script is killing it
* softpipe solves a number of failures
* now looking for other failures

Sotaro:
* game that renders yellow, async decoding render doesn't happen
