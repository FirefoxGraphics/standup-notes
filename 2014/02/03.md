* context client host, one is apzc regression

Jeff:
* LLVM soft pipe could fix reftest failures?

Nicolas:
* removing deprecated code
* almost there to turn on new textures on windows to then remove that code

Botond:
- Investigated bug 966258 and bug 966282, which turned out to be regressions 
  caused by the patch for bug 962791 (Cancel button disappearing). Both
  regressions involved panning and zooming being very broken on specific
  pages. The regressions were quite a bit worse than the bug the patch was
  fixing, and Timothy and I did not have an obvious solution at hand, so
  we decided to back out the patch from central and aurora.
    - This means we'll have to revisit bug 962791 and provide a better patch.
- Continued looking into bug 964517 (text overlapping in AccuWeather app).
  Still having a lot of trouble due to networking/wireless issues on the
  Hamachi, but still slowly making progress.
