kats:
* filed bug 977831 about coordinate systems that don't make sense, needed for the hit testing bug
* filed bug 977625 with patch to fix a b2g-emulator mochitest hang i was seeing locally
* put together a patch for bug 975962 to handle overflow:hidden things better
* got bug 969378 uplifted to help with apzc fallback scenarios
* spent this morning fixing my router setup :(
* PTO mon-wed next week

botond
* composition bounds patch (bug 935219)
* cannot repro mochitest failures locally; requested access to Try machine
* zooming oveflow:hidden iframes (bug 975962)
* talked to :dbaron to clarify that this is a bug, not a TE issue
* discussed possible approached with BenWa
* overscroll handoff for flings (bug 965871)
* posted WIP patch; still needs some debugging and cleanup

Chris:
* euro-tiling, fixed returning locked tiles to the pool issue
* get genlock failures when playing video for a while, but it seems to be independent of tiling - perhaps the changes to gralloc texture hos

Bas:
* no leaks on windows
* euro-tiling
* texture pool

Nicolas:
* memory usage in euro-tiling.  convinced we're not leaking gralloc texture host or gralloc from tiles - just using a lot of texture clients, maybe we don't need as many, looking at some ideas
* on try, some fennec crashes
* need layout changes, layer heuristics

BenWa:
* Got tile recycling working without the compositor syncing.
* Was working on recycling tiles on the compositor on refcount = 0 but its got way to complicated

bjacob
* some will-change crash fixes (975769, 975789)
* working on enabling will-change for Certified Gaia apps before we can enable it for general Web content (977757)

Jeff:
* sync transactions in gralloc allocation (scrollbar!)
* the problem is that we're painting it - we need layout to be convinced it isn't changing

Sotaro:
* build failure on flatfish
* master hamachi build broken by CodeAurora, patching Gecko, Git messed up
* Fence on KitKat, waiting for review
* media bugs
