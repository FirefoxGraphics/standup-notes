bjacob, dan, george to be ready with b2g builds


________________


Jeff G:
* WebGL 1 extensions out the door
* color buffer float extensions are probably not implementable on ANGLE
* trying to guarantee we're calling MakeCurrent when we need to; have a simpler and a large statically done patch.  will take it under advisement

Morris:
* removing dependencies in layer scope, patch landed
* UI changes to layer scope (avoid typing in the IP address)
* test failure on Android (ICS), assertion during monkey test

Peter:
* layer stream design, sharing with webrtc
* aiming for this week

Matt:
* 3d transform bugs
* helping with software OMTC, passes all Linux reftests
* Bill wants to ship software OMTC on Linux on 30
* available to work on desktop tiling

Jerry:
* Gallery OOM problem - lots of issues on the Gaia side
* Gecko profiler work - simple connection function

Dan:
* refactoring webgl texture calls, commonality into a reused function
* some webgl security/crashes issues
* one of the tests with a deadlock, try to figure out if it's related to the patch

Bas:
* push clips crash, there are some issues with the current landed patch, needs more work
* unclear if the nightly builds contains the patch, but no crashes with the old signature (yet)
* some font work

Chris:
* initial tiling to new textures port is done, another day or so to get it ready for feedback/review
* friday and monday pto

George:
* two issues with update skia pinpointed: some shaders make emulator unhappy, see if bjacob can help

Nicolas:
* shutdown protocol

Sotaro:
* content host/client, one bug checked in
* genlock failure, confirming the fix

Jeff:
* switched back to softpipe
* Masa patch, will take against the mailing list
* volatile buffers for imagelib
* helped George

BenWa:
* Interviewed
* Patch for texture_range
* Enabled gtest on windows integration - bounced for PGO timeouts :(
* Discussing texturing locking for mac client storage
* Interesting bug: 971269 - High html5 video power usage

kats:
* mostly drilling down into bug 966397. isolated the code that's causing the problem, i think it's a coordinate system mismatch. will post my findings and needinfo people
* filed bug 971001 to get a networking change backed out, so that AWSY runs don't time out. some investigation was required there
* listened in on town hall/manager hacking talks

bjacob:
* Finished writing patches for the second round of fuzzing. Now getting to 17% of reftest before the parent process crashes.
* Unfortunately, there is a third round with already two severe crashes. Details on https://intranet.mozilla.org/User:Bjacob@mozilla.com/Gfx_IPC_fuzzing
