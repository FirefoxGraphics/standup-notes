BenWa:
* Filed 4 bugs (blocking 942750) to fix: background color not scrolling, overhead in text drawing, reflowing while scrolling, image decode should only decode thumbnail)
* Planned Talos profiling work with Viktor

botond
* reviewed a couple of patches for Kats
* continued investigating bug 964517 (text overlapping in AccuWeather app)
* looked at invalidation dumps, doesn't look like invalidation problem
* took some moz2d recordings, set up moz2d player to view them
* not working at the moment, perhaps due to format mismatch between recorder and player
* APZC tree logging patches are now all reviewed, just about ready to land
* causing strange linker error on Fennec, need to look into it

kats:
* wrote/landed bug 967098 to expose various displayport heuristics in the developer settings
* provided feedback to doug and Cwiiis for other displayport/checkerboarding changes that could be made
* looking at bug 963584 (keyboard not showing) which seems to be increasing in impact (more people seeing it)

Jeff:
* image downscaling, rough plan for the part of it
* with Benoit profiles for scrolling, a couple of patches that we might as well fix
* the slave is back

Nicolas:
* Moz2D with Telenor
* layer borders for tiling
* with Gaia at the position sticky fix to call log, might make it better in contacts, fewer reflows (942460)

Bas:
* D3D11
* bug in Player2D

Chris:
* the patch to stop the checkerboarding - it doesn't jank often enough to make it worse - feels good to never checkboard

bjacob
* Patched Faulty to fuzz only gfx/layers protocols. Nontrivialness: faulty works at pickle level. Used that to take layers IPC fuzzing much further (filed several bugs, more to come).
* Talked moz2dification w/ Bas
* Talked Skia/GL unique GLContext w/snorp

Sotaro:
* JB HWC FB problem - only on QC hardware, just helped QC try and fix it themselves
* B2G 1.3 blocker, gamepack, not much progress
