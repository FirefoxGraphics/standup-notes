kats:
* Backed out bug 965593 after much argument and debate
* Relanded bug 965945 with test change
* Landed bug 960146 for Chris (fennec dynamic toolbar sec bug)
* Got two gaia-apzc-2 blockers closed as WFM since they don't repro anymore (on 1.4 anyway)
* Currently working on bug 898563 (almost done) and then will look at touch-sensitive region stuff

BenWa:
* eclipse project generation
* will-change throttling

Sotaro:
* games issue; caused by coordinate conversion in canvas, when Y is flipped

bjacob:
* Landed 11 of 25 patches for IPC fuzzing issues

Bas, Nicolas, Chris:
* tiling
* EGL image binding slow - Sotaro's suggestion correct, going after each tile on different texture
* have to worry about unbinding, some contention problems
* with the patches that are around, shmem is comparable to buffer rotation
* (for testing D3D11 worked out of the box, using Metro's tools helps with performance)
* gralloc is getting better, shmem is better
* contention doesn't seem to be hurting us
* double buffering, port to new textures

Botond:
* black background bug (gallery use case), same as 957668 - going with a Gaia work around
* couldn't reproduce e-mail app, will retry
* eclipse with BenWa
* APZC tree logging
