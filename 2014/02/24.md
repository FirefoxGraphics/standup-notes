kats:
* landed patch for bug 968991 to fix a bug in TabChild that gets tickled by the OOP keyboard
* landed patch for bug 898563 (IPC hardening), with a followup this morning for bug 976030 (typo in original patch)
* dusted off the patches for bug 941995 (removing the 300ms delay for double-tap in some cases) which is now 1.4+
* confirmed that bug 975033 is caused by a too-big composition bounds
* going to start digging into bug 918288 which blocks bug 973096 on the gaia-apzc-2 list

Jeff:
* downsize on decode.  jpeg only.  aiming for a patch for seth today.  have test cases.
* haven't heard anything bad from David F. about this patch

Sotaro:
* game rendering bug, coordinate spaces and transforms were bad

bjacob
* IPC fuzzing: landed 7 more patches (now at 18 landed out of 25)
* Left to land: mostly the Shmem patches, hopefully I can do that today
* Linux startup hangs: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=973192

BenWa:
* onsite + debrief
* Code reviews for the profiler
* Discussed talos symbolication with Viktor
* mason landed a patch to make the render frame parent opaque!
* Working on the will-change limiting

Botond:
* composition bounds patch
* apzc tree logging - clean try
* C++ meeting blogpost (https://botondballo.wordpress.com/2014/02/22/trip-report-c-standards-committee-meeting-in-issaquah-february-2014/)

Chris:
* gralloc and tiling
* tiling inefficient, need to minimize the amount of data being copied
* texture contention (too long a description to capture in notes live :)

Nicolas:
* tiling with Chris and Bas
* landed some new textures patches
* some canvas mac patches

Bas:
* tiling and timing; all performance is gated on recreating or reusing gralloc - either expensive, or guaranteeing that it's unlocked
* share buffers between tiles or not?

Martijn:
* testing 965593 - fixes the issue, haven't seen much performance issues
