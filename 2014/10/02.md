* mapbufferrange project close to completion (David on emscripten)
* David with invalidate frame buffer next

Bas:
* D2D1.1, some inconsistencies how we activate back ends - canvas is the place of failure
* canvas is thus doing readback, tests didn't notice, maybe we can get rid of readback in that case anyway

* did a bit of investigation on bug 1062792 and bug 1071235

mchang
* bug 1073545, 1075096 - Added vsync and layer transaction markers in the profiler. Front end code landed, backend waiting on try
