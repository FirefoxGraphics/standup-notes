Nical:
* D3D11 blacklist instead of HWA blacklist
* D3D11 handling errors/injecting failures

Jeff M & bjacob:
* 33 blackscreen D3D11
* reduced testcase on D3D10 works fine
* IE11 has the same problem - but they use a slightly different codepath (copy out, no shader)

kats:
* finished up WIPs for bug 1083395 (first part of hit testing), just doing final touches before putting it up for review
* responding to feedbacks, needinfos, mentored bugs, etc.

* bug 1055741 (unify 'local Screen' and 'ParentLayer' coordinate systems)
* finished patch, got tests to pass, posted for review
* apz-css-transforms, stage 2

sotaro
* working TabChild::InitRenderingState() improvement. Creating prototype.

David:
* working prototype for Windows E10S APZ
* WebGL2 demo, waiting for the source access

Dan:
* WebGL2 demo, tools and now runs but stuck in an infinite loop, no interaction with Firefox
* with David, Benoit, Jeff, partners

Jeff G:
* OS X with core profile, can load WebGL, use new extensions
* we cannot request #bits per channel in the frame buffer, so no good way to do sanity checks
* D3D11 Angle fixes
* GL context changes (split frame buffer may be needed for the demo)
* D3D11 keyed mutexes door getting opened
* shared surfaces texture client in progress

Jerry:
* vsync aligned compositor
* next - refresh driver aligned
* gtest framework for the vsync dispatcher
