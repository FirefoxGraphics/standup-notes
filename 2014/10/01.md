bjacob:
* demo build; trouble as they added dependency on an external, non-sharable package
* continuing with tex storage patch, added state tracking, validation, now under review; conformance test upcoming
* 3d textures

Bas:
* crash stats on beta, tracking OMTC, looking OK so far
* D2D 1.1 rates - 80% on release and 60% on beta; a bit unexpected
* D2D 1.1 build - the mysterious failure seems to be gone, and we have others we're tracking

Jeff:
* clipping cleanup
* rotation bugs fixes landed
* comparing ANGLE results with chrome

Nical:
* Wrote up most of my gralloc cleanup proposal
* a few reviews
* saw a doctor (took a big chunk of today unfortunately)

Dan:
* WebGL2 infrastructure landed; bjacob looking at texture formats
* Walter's strong types helped
* 912196

Mason
* bug 1075096 - Composite times are abnormal - Looks like we're measuring a composite from when we get a layer transaction, not when we CompositeToTarget.
* glSwap() blocks until vsync on master,  but not on silk branch. Investigating
* bug 1073545 - put vsync markers in the profiler. Also found a nice way to convert between mozilla::TimeStamp and android timestamps.

Jeff G:
* texture formats in ANGLE
* blending problem, still following up
* surfacestream removal - a lot of work, failing reftests

kats:
* made some progress on bug 1043859 with the scrollbar positioning, still need to figure out a clipping problem
* add an inverse function to Matrix classes in Moz2D (pending review from Bas) - bug 1074944
* investigated a bunch of bugs. some turned out to be dupes of bug 1070993

Jerry:
* performance label for silk to prevent regressions (vsync interval)
* test cases for each module delay - don't have a good idea for automatic test

David:
* welcome!

sotaro
* Implementing Fence::merge() reduction
