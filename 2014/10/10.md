* D2D 1.1

bjacob:
* 3d textures support for WebGL2, going after the conformance tests

* Need to prototype the GPU profiling UI

mchang:
* bug 1069037 - Prevent touch events from piling up if the main thread is busy
* Have everyone on the same plan to land the compositor + a simpler vsync dispatcher first
* Touch resampling + compositor aligned vsync is very janky, investigating.

* more work on hit-testing
* tried to review some of kip's patches
* some investigation on bug 1071620

* Fixed the gralloc patch, it works great and removes a lot of code
* updating my patch in bug 966284 (one of my shutdown nemesis bugs)
