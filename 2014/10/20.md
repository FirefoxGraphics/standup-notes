jrmuizel:
* All the d3d11 stuff I have has gone through try successfully
* Next angle update is blocked on texture format mismatches again. It's a similar problem to the d3d11 failures that we see now
* ANGLE keyed mutex patch nearly ready for upstreaming

BenWa:
* Handling more cases with the will-change budget. Another try push
* Discussed vsync reviews some more with mchang
* Got GPU frame level beginquery. It should be trivial to implement with D3D with the current design.

kats:
* helping tn with bug 1076783
* more incoming bug triage/investigations
* some investigation on bug 1083818 to try and get rid of click-simulation code in gaia homescreen
* continuing to work on hit-testing (latest WIPs on bug 918288 and 1083395)

botond:
* bug 1076163 (apz-css-transforms, stage 1)
* addendum to part 1 patch about root composition size
* addressed review comments for part 2 patch
* bug 1055741 (unifying 'local Screen' and 'ParentLayer' coordinate spaces)
* large parts done, WIP patch posted, will finish today

mchang
* Another round of vsync aligned compositor
* Refactoring touch resampling to work with the vsync framework

bjacob:
* WebGL2, fixing Unity issues right now, Dan’s doing some crazy stuff
* demo starts, doesn’t get any errors, but gets stuck in infinite loop
* will continue on what Dan has done

sotaro
* Worked for camera preview glitch bug. 
* Fix nexus-7 camera preview problem.

Nical:
* going through reports and adding drivers to the blacklist
* What's the threshold that we are comfortable saying "all drivers older than this date will not get any hardware acceleration?" (we have some fairly recent drivers failing so I am adding them one by one to the blacklist at the moment)
* we don't handle hd4000 in the blacklist code?
