Bas:
* D2D1.1
* Moz2D merge, player working
* Mask surface leak in Skia
* Point is larger now (20 vs 8 bytes) - do we know why?

Jeff
* Skia ref tests, out of bugs we want to fix - fuzzing now, together with performance
* will want to draw directly into D3D9 texture

Nical:
* working on a patch for bug 1060703, hoping it happens to be the cause for the Linux OMTC reftest failure
* Looking at the bugs blocking 1061693 (Windows OMTC stability)
* landed 1059793 (BadPixmap with OMTC + gl layers on Linux)
* made a patch for Bug 1061209 (issues with basic compositor on Mac)

BenWa:
* Blog post for transaction delay indicator
* Working on gaia compositor regression backend
* Filed bug 1060528, starting to work on the ui-test

DanG:
* Profiling Jukka's test apps with WPA.
* Not seeing the low, low frame rates reported.
* Pulled out old laptop that has Intel 3000 (+ nVidia Optimus but I tried forcing firefox to use the Intel GPU via nVidia control panel)
* Taking a different tack and investigating the "jitter" in requestAnimationFrame.
* Using this https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40949268/emcc/VSyncTest/VSyncTest.html from Bug 927625
* Running on my desktop confirms the report. http://www.bounceapp.com/150405
* Similar on OSX too.
* Record a trace with WPA. http://www.bounceapp.com/150403
* Overview of sampling from 10k ft view. Nothing sticks out as low hanging fruit. http://www.bounceapp.com/150406
* Zoom in to get more details on what a frame looks like. This is my attempt to reproduce Cleopatra UI. http://www.bounceapp.com/150411
* VSync analysis. Looks like we're hitting 60fps or there about. Compositor has heaps of headroom. http://www.bounceapp.com/150412. Maybe rAF variation is from using raw delta times. If we're locked to VSync then we should only send through multiples of the base refresh rate to get smooth animation. (Otherwise we'll get "temporal" aliasing - images shown at one rate but object moves at a different rate - object with move fast than slow than fast than slow)
* TODO: Investigate how rAF delta is calculated. I could be way off.
* What's happening in the "sawtooths"? Looks like DWM wakes up content thread, which runs and wakes up the compositor, with a couple other background threads thrown in for good measure. http://www.bounceapp.com/150414.
* One of the "sawtooth" didn't look like the others. http://www.bounceapp.com/150417. I looks like we missed a composite, or didn't composite. Or, I don't know since I haven't investigated yet. I'll be looking for an answer to this tomorrow.

mchang:
* Landed touch resampling, bug 970751

sotaro
* HERE Maps consume more than 80MB kgsl memory problem.
* Implemented for Canvas2D. It works. mattwoddrow's feedback was good.
* Implementing for WebGL

Botond:
 - bug 1057578 (overscroll alternative: uniform stretch effect)
     - meeting with UX where we decided to land this in its current form before the merge
     - wrote up proper (non-prototype) patches, got them reviewed and landed
 - bug 1058884 (follow-up to multi-layer-apz to update some compositor code)
     - finished working on patch for layer borders, got reviewed and landed
     - overscroll background drawing code not needed with new approach; will file follow-up to delete
     - confirmed with Jeff that uniformity info code does not need changes
 - tested multi-layer-apz patches a bit
     - found a regression, reported it to roc
     - helped tn debug a failing test
 - successfully built Fennec; will look into bug 1024872 when I get a chance
