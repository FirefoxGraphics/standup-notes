BenWa:
* Found the failure with my opacity change to nsDisplayImage. The bounds don't reflect where we paint
* Small reviews
* Fixed eclipse patch, landed both of them
* b2g regressions flipping settings
* Filed a bug about the lockscreen painting the slider on unlock
* Wrote a new patch for the eclipse mach front end

Nical:
* Day full of sadness:
* Tried to investigate the surge of OOM with OMTC windows
* VS2013's graphics debugging stuff crashes firefox at startup
* Intel GPA fails to attach to firefox or crash
* My Linux setup doesn't boot anymore
* Another r- on the OMTC shutdown deadlock, I have a new patch on try
* Looked at async-shutdown (Bug 918317) to give some feedbacks. Hopefully will help with all of the shutdown issues we have, but first we need to port XPCOM's shutdown to it.

kats:
* PTO + catch up
* will land bug 1053992 and work on bug 1013385
