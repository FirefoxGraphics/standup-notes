* landed some small follow-ups for the layer margins work (bug 989054)
* uplifted various things to aurora
* tested progressive painting and low-res painting, they seem to work out-of-the-box but may need some debugging to improve perf. see comments on bug 993473 + dep tree
* updated apz-side patch for scrollbars on bug 980500
* reviewing a big patchset for botond

botond
* bug 976605 (moving touch handlers from BEP.js -> C++)

Matt
* Kept inbound closed most of the day with bug 974197
* Hung the majority of the OSX test slaves with https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=1061354610d7. Apparently if you hang a machine, then buildbot will keep rescheduling the same push on other machines.
* Got angry trying to figure out how to reproduce the gaia integratation test failures for bug 974197.
* Reviewed some patches
* Fixed a regression from bug 992486 that broke scrolling with D3D11 compositor

jrmuizel
* Working on skia reftest failures on Windows
* Looked with bjacob at the mochitest crash

Chris:
* Linux basic compositor
* Fixed masking issues
* Mask squashing issue
* Will look at the opacity performance issue as well

Sotaro:
* b2g camera related bugs
