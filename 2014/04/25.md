Bas:
* ImageBridge problem has a patch (async video in the clear)
* two more test failures (form list boxes, 80% failure rate)
* three more tests to fuzz

Sotaro:
* mwu's patch shared surface gralloc review (fence related performance, we can use a newly available extension, as we don't worry about ICS performance)
* we may not need to use native window, instead use the extension and get the similar performance improvement
* camera preview bug (ImageBridge and layer had inconsistent info)

Nical:
* rebased, landed, relanded patches for bug 924622 & bug 993004
* needinfos
* reviews

gw280:
* The feColorMatrix-not-rendering-bug (bug 996978) appears to be due to DWrite fonts not being supported by Skia, as well as due to us trying to use DWrite fonts with Skia. The former already has a fix for the most part, but the latter is still leaving me stumped. If we have an feColorMatrix set, then we seem to use a DWrite font, and if not then we use a Win font object.

kats:
* uplifted bug 993554 to aurora which was the most severe fennec regression
* fixed bug 999162 where the first scroll after a same-document location change didn't work
* landed bug 992218 (with update from nical) on inbound
* filed bug 1001438 with some patches to move the low-res buffer calculation into gecko, this should make it trivial to enable low-res and progressive painting on b2g
* did some mentoring on bug 1000287, reviews, etc
* going to go back to bug 995129 (background color fennec regression) now

botond
* helped Nical and Milan check some calculations related to orientation and coordinate changes
* investigated an APZ data race (bug 1000633), patch forthcoming
* investigated bug 993930 (full-screen video -> switch app -> app is tiny), posted patch that fixes the issue
* filed bug to track various issues with eclipse project generation

BenWa:
* Discussed changes to devtools performance tool with paul
* Progressing reflow/restyle causes
