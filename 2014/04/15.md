kats:
* figured out the underlying problem for bug 984460, got a patch up for review (will likely need tweaking)
* doing a little code maintenance on APZ which i'd like to get in for 31 since it's an ESR release and not doing it in 31 will mean rebasing for uplifts

* fixed test failures
* now has clean Try push, ready to land
