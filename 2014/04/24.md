Bas:
* last perf test failures
* OMT video decoding; ImageBridge shutdown related issues (deadlock)

Sotaro:
* memory leak on 1.4; fixed in master, texture client leak
* found more problems (PTexture shutdown - sync and async delete - during async IPC, we don't accept delete message)
* fence object related issue (possibly) as well

Nical:
* Bug 993004: patch up for review (wrong clipping with rotated screens on b2g)
* filed 1000916 as a followup (compositor's screen rotation is updated too early)
* Bug 924622: patch up for review (shutdown sadness)
* some feedbacks to jgilbert's SurfaceStream for windows

BenWa:
* Talos profiling handoff
* Discussed MakeCurrent with bjacob and async animation with Paul
* Interviewed
* chrome is shipping will-change
* Working on reflow causes

kats:
* put up a patch for the Fennec tiling glitches (bug 992218)
* a couple of misc cleanups (bug 1000170)
* reviewed a bunch of stuff
* put together some patches for fling acceleration (aka flywheel scrolling) bug 907123
* the checkerboarding concerns me even though it UX said they could live with it. would like to enable low-res tiles and progressive painting for b2g to see if it helps much here
* looking into recently reported bug 999162
* bug 995129 does appear to be a tiling regression so looking into that as well
