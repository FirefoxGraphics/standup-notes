Bas:
* performance story still a mystery
* waiting for Matt's change to see what it changes in the tests
* win omtc patches landing and upcoming
* why are some try runs failing all webgl tests?

bjacob:
* progress on the Skia blitter bug: we know which of the two hunks is causing the problem; the no-alpha is not being propagated, so we try to read where nothing was set in the alpha channel
* context sharing may complicate things here

Jeff:
* reftest hunting Skia
* with bjacob on the above
* infinite loop on Windows
* meeting with Mike Reed, enthused about patches

Sotaro:
* async transactions work, patches close to reviewable
* Gonk version complications (still using some GB approaches) helping Taipei with this

Matt
* Removed the remaining thebes from <canvas> (Bug 997014)
* More work on throttling the refresh driver, almost green on osx
* looking into poor image performance on OSX (bug 997551)

Nical:
* 924622: bullet-proofing ImageBridge shutdown and pushing to try to see how it goes
* Updated the MozSurface design doc
* submitted a patch for 996745 (windows omtc mochitest crashes)
* trying to get a b2g build for bug 993004 but I get errors related to libOmxAdpcmDec.so - fixed (remove the backup-hamachi folder)
* try push with software omtc on windows looks good since the failing tests are the ones testing hardware accelerated layers: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=a6030dc4867e
* remaining failures: https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=a6030dc4867e

kats:
* moved APZ code into gfx/layers/apz (plus more unified build fixes) - bug 995411 + deps
* figured out a workaround for bug 993554 and its (many) duplicates. have a patch for review to uplift to aurora
* currently looking at the other reported fennec regressions to see if there's anything else that needs fixing
* matt didn't respond to my needinfo on bug 984460 so i'll have to go back to that and look at the reftest failures
* uplifting stuff to aurora
