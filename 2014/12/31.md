Bas:
* text disappearing bug, combo of D2D and layout and print preview, a bit stuck



BenWa:
* Working on disable draw heuristics for non APZ content, saw that nical might of found the underlying failure.
* Found my failure for enabling display list code. Valgrind doesn't understand the inlining with MakeUnique. Thinks we use malloc+delete.



botond:
* bug 1076241 (APZ blocker for containerless scrolling)
* addressed review comments, posted updated patch
* latest patch is passing tests, just needs r+ from :tn on part 1
* started reviewing kats' patches for bug 1109873 (new design for part of APZ hit-testing work)
* made an attempt to land the flip-the-switch patch for b2g Werrors, but it was backed out even after several bustage fixes



jrmuizel:
* Found out that the D2D debug layer was causing machine hangs during child-process exit
* patch up for review, WebGL broken with E10S
* refcounting static analysis reviews
