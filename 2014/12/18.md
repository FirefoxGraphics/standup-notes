Jeff:
* have a fix for angle d3d11 keyed mutex, will send for review, not happy, but seems to work
* not doing the single sync texture, recreating render target view instead



Bas:
* device disable follow up, cache clearing doesn't quite do it
* Moz2D didn't know about devices being disabled



Nical:
* Patches up for review for the Tiled DrawTarget on b2g
* patch for bug 1110268 (windows aurora top crasher)
* on my computer the reftests aren't much slower with OMTC on linux, only gfx-related code showing up in profiles is the read-back of xlib surfaces to compare the tests with their references (I assume that's what nsDOMWindowUtils::CompareCanvases is for).



kats:
* making some progress on bug 1109873, posted a wip of part 1
* reviewed more patches by mason and dvander
* landed a mentored bug



mchang
* bug 1102453 - Landed how we read vsync status on b2g

BenWa:
* Worked on various issues with display list visualization



sotaro
* Investigated b2gv2.0 camera preview problem. It became clear that the problem is caused by HWC bug.
* Investigated tryserver failure when enabling FLAC support. the failure happen only on b2g debug build. Locally I could not reproduce it by using devices and emulator.
