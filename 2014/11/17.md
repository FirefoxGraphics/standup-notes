Bas:
* Bing maps problem (complex clip simplification wasn't doing the right thing for D2D1.1)
* imaglib with Seth

botond
* on PTO the first half of Friday
* investigated bug 1099104, a Fennec rendering regression caused by bug 1076163
* landed a temporary fix; will follow up with a proper fix in bug 1099298
* investigated and posted a patch for bug 1093298, a bug in the new overscroll bounce effect
* began investigating bug 1096513, another issue with the overscroll bounce effect

mstange:
* finished patches for bug 1097776 (3d pixman transform precision issue)
* using Skia instead of pixman would probably be simpler and faster, trying that today
* briefly investigated different approach to fixing Fennec scroll invalidations using the current JS code, unsuccessful as of now (I added a method to nsIDOMWindowUtils that lets you set a fractional CSS scroll position)
* finished reviewing OS X Vsync (bug 552020) and suggested approach to fixing Talos crashes caused by too early gfxPrefs initialization
* talked to jwatt about resurrecting the patches in bug 944571 (using accelerated D2D filters for box-shadow blurring)

Nical:
* patch for the texture sync hack
* looked at bug 1098895 (image layers flickering on beta), but can't reproduce. Might have been fixed by one of the patch uplifted recently since the reporter could only reproduce on beta and not the other channels at the time (and it was probably a couple of updates ago.
* landed the gralloc fix (Bug 1098000)
* struggled a bit with hacking into ContentClient to always invalidate everything (to help Jeff with investigating the broken D3D11 laptop) but I only managed to break rendering so far :)

kats:
* investigated bug 1099104 (fennec regression from apz-css-transforms work) and diagnosed the problem
* sorted out a couple of issues with my hit-testing part 3 patches
* discussed bug 1086162 with dvander and reviewed his patch for it
* reviewed kip's patch for bug 1086723
* looked at what appeared to be a talos regression/improvement but seems unrelated

mchang
* bug 552020 - Landed OS X Vsync then backed out for talos crashes. Investigated what caused crashes.

BenWa:
* Progress on retaining/invalidating intermediate surface
* Down to one failure for the avoid framebuffer switch patch, can't reproduce on mac, trying on linux

sotaro
* Update a patch of TabChild::InitRenderingState() improvement. The pach is already merged to m-c.
* Update a patch of gralloc usage on WebRTC video on gonk.

jrmuizel
* Convinced myself that sync texture hack should work everywhere and landed it on nightly (need to decide if we want to land it on beta)
* Did some triage
