Nical:
* looked at the HandleError crash, didn't go anywhere.
* looked at Bug 1036682 (crash in ipdl when creating a texture actor), have a patch that may fix the bug, if not it'll tell us that it is an actor id mismatch inside of ipdl (really hope not)
* catched up with emails and reviews

mchang

* spent some time figuring out the new mozreview and hg workflow

* did some investigations on bug 1096042, bug 1095709 and bug 1095702

botond:
* unbitrotted my local apz-css-transforms patch queue
* various discussions about C++, including a design discussion with :djvj
* helped :dvander investigate some issues that came up while working on bug 1076192 (containerless scrolling for root scroll frames)
* reviewed some of Kats' patches (bug 1094803, bug 1090398), more to come
* filed several bugs about nightly

* Getting the ATI problem machine (coming in from Ro)
* moving GLBlitTextureImageHelper from GLContext  to layers/opengl

jgilbert:

* Format tables is needs landing
* RGBA backbuffer for ANGLE needs landing
* Debugging a demo bug caused by an ANGLE update on Beta
* Investigating record and replay for webgl

dvander:
* APZ patches on window up for review
* heuristics are still up in the air
* only really effective on e10s
* blocked on event hit-testing stuff from kats

Jerry
* 998916 - webgl context handling. uplift to 2.0
