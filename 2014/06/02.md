kats:
* investigating a bit more on bug 1017065 (reftest-ipc fails locally, possibly a real bug)
* rip out some unused fennec widget code that was blocking jwatt (bug 1018980)
* threw together a quick patch for bug 1004266 (tarako blocker) but it doesn't look like it helped

botond:
* overscroll effects
* discussion with Kats, Milan, and Gordon about physics, came up with ideas to iterate on current physics
* Milan has a local patch with some improvements
* I will combine it with other improvements to present an updated version
* bug 1014280 (background for overscroll effect)
* had discussion with Kats and BenWa
* will try a different approach that is more correct
* bug 1007728 (avoiding UPZCT calls for repeat transactions)
* have patch implementing the basic idea, will improve it

Sotaro:
* tarako blocker, have a local fix, as an uplift, so we need to uplift more
* tarako has a GPU driver bug, we're bypassing it

Jeff:
* inbound fun
* transform regions in place, helped the 100 layers benchmark

Bas:
* SVG
* performance
* back buffer lazy creation, trying a patch

BenWa:
* Discussed with vporof the FPS actor
* Looked into performance bugs with multiple layers. Focused on the complex region code.
