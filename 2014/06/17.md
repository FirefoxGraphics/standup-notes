Nical:
* Looking at bug 1014355 - Have an idea and a patch, not sure it fixes it (haven't repro locally)
* reviews
* talked with bjacob about shutdown

BenWa:
* e10s patch review
* Landed opacity flatenning
* Looked at why were not getting HWC for webgl. System app is abusing will-change
* Progress on syncing video to profiles. Code to walk through the video, code to lock the video time range to the selection.
* Requested uplift for css transform 'regression'

Bas:
* D2D performance issues - SW may be easier to get working well, maybe that's a good start
* GDI is hurting us, we should move to Cairo image back end (will that work for text?!)

Sotaro:
* small b2g regressions, one done, one to go

Jeff:
* Skia reftest failures, non-monotonic Beziers
* Chrome HW acceleration of filters (SkiaGL), but perhaps not particularly fast - we should time it

kats:
* tracked down a fennec regression from some of the low-res work, bug 1025562. patches up for review now
* flagged a gaia patch for uplift to enable overscroll on 2.0, bug 1026116
* dual booted my nexus 4 so i can run fennec and b2g both. grabbed more screenshots for bug 1020778. need to redo the thing where i put Fira sans on fennec because i did it wrong before. also apparently hinting is disabled and enabling it doesn't make a noticeable difference
* a big review for doug and the overlay keyboard
* get back to bug 1021248 which was backed out earlier for a reftest failure
