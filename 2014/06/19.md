Bas:
* day off
* Cairo flattening paths for every tile - we need to cache as things are slow

Sotaro:
* fence delivery issues with tiled layers, review comment addressed

jrmuizel
* skia reftests (more blending fixes) I'm going to look into doing something a bit more systematic here that's upstreamable
* began looking at moz2d skia filters

Nical:
* Fixed and Landed the BadPixmap issue, patch ready for uplift as well

BenWa:
* Landed final patch for video profiling
* Profiled the vertical homescreen. Posted a patch to use will-change: transform during the edit mode only
* Minor tweak to the profiler video feature
* Posted a patch to improve paint flashing when there's an invactive layer manager
* Found the problem causing us to scale the app-window, have an extra thebes layer and miss HWC. Asking system app to size app window to whole device pixel.
* Porting our logging to stringstream to make it cheaper to collect layers and display list data in profiles.
