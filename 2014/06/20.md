kats:
* after some more investigation with jrmuizel, got to the bottom of the "heavy low-res text" in B2G. Turns out it's actually Fennec that's too light, because of texture coordinates. Back to square one in terms of what to change to make it more light across the board
* got a first cut of patches up for bug 1021085, but they have bugs. working through them now

BenWa:
* Landed layer log streaming
* Re-landed invalidation improvement
* Looking into many layers in the edit screens. We're going to need to avoid draw calls by culling clipped images. Otherwise we have a performance problem with the fence calling dup/close.
* Landed a small patch to avoid region copy
* Re-found that we have a rounding layer when syncing layers causing them to jump, especially at low velocity

Bas:
* with jwatt on some moz2d work; draw target changes (get type/get backend type)
* hw/sw differentiation ready for skia
* with woodrow on performance with intel
* "recording‚Äù conversations
* intel bugs, can't reproduce locally

Nicolas:
* easy bugs for bug squashing party
* push clips triaging
* shutdown conversations
* MozSurface discussion follow up from last week (Sotaro discussions)

Sotaro:
* landed fence fix for tiled layers
* John H and local video playback (b2g) - too much power problem - triaging, a few possible culprits - have a patch to do it the Android way to see what that does to power
* necko main thread delivery issue - already some bugs, but the callback can only be used when IPC is not, so B2G is not quite covered - a cause for the browser slowness?  Maybe PBackground is something to look at
* b2g is going to be more compared to Android this year
