kats:
* landed change to reduce opacity of low-res content, bug 1020778 and adjusted overscroll prefs, bug 1025507
* landed bug 1024126 which fixed some rounding errors and added a danger zone to the checkerboarding heuristic
* backed out patch for bug 1021248 for supposedly causing bug 1028271. i believe my patch for bug 1024126 fixes 1028271 properly, and bug 1021248 no longer seems to repro so i might just resolve it as WORKSFORME
* currently looking at bug 1022956 (tapping triggers clicks while scrolling) and then will move on to overscroll bugs

Bas:
* recording draw target (efficient, same process) - we  have to figure out the names between the old one (stream?) and this one something else, to separate between them
* Intel related bug

Jeff:
* Skia rasterization bug - fix is to make Skia's different rasterization methods the same

Sotaro:
* media b2g bugs
* regression in video playback, have a patch that caused it
