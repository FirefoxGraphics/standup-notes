kats:
* fixed bug 1027309, bug 1023506 (b2g-2.0+). this should also have fixed bug 1026683 and bug 1029971.
* landed bug 1030181 as well which removes a bunch of duplicated code
* discussion with mchang about moving input events onto a separate thread (probably the vsync thread, eventually)
* got an r- on bug 1022956, needs a test. working on that now

Sotaro:
* investigate camera preview memory leak - EGL swap during HWC, copybit version, seems to be used incorrectly.  In B2G, we are not independent form surface flinger/copybit, like Android it.  QC is doing an optimization to reuse buffers and this eventually ends up as a memory leak.
* Patch from QC on this, fixes the issue, but it adds three more buffers
* We may need some OpenGL code to fully fix this
* Asked Jessup about WebRTC modifications to media hw codec.  Will help as Taipei seems to be busy.  H264 decoder.

Jeff:
* Skia reftests - more clipping invariant bad stuff, with curves (they're clipped analytically).  Not clear that it's advantageous to clip them in the first place.
