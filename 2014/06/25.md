Bas:
* have a patch for the OMTC on Aurora off
* draw target capture
* another incoming OMTC issue, should be reproducible
* Moz2D standalone up to date now

Jeff:
* Skia reftests, SVG directory, will have to fuzz some gradient tests (the location of the gradient dictates the result which is not the best, but fast)
* our region clipping on top of Skia is less than ideal; Skia doesn't know about regions giving us "fast" options - you have to explicitly clip to a region instead

Sotaro:
* b2g regressions, incorrect thread IPC communication, have a patch
* memory leak on camera preview

kats:
* wrote up a patch for bug 1022956, pending review
* working on bug 1027309. have WIPs, still need to fix up and test a few things

Peter:
* remote frame; side effects on the current approach, discussing with Matt
* will continue into 2.1; Rob proposed an approach, will follow that - pass the id to the compositor
* the current approach would change the layout, so we will try to avoid it
* tried to help with 1.4 bug, could be repeat property

Jerry:
* silk; adding some timing debug info, to log frame delays, latency, etc.
* in some test cases, the content process receives events very late
* test with changing priorities
* want to combine input and tick events, need to capture performance data first

Chiajung
* imagelib for dynamic_texture support of ImageElement
* ARM MM Seminar in APAC

Walter:
* Skia bugs cleared
* WebGL, a few more performance bugs

Jeff:
* OMTC WebGL landed, trying to uplift to Aurora - no need
* makeCurrent trying to land on all platforms, even without plug-ins
* misc bugs
* design for streaming (surface stream replacement)

Dan:
* WebGL2, pushing to finish all the "not yet implemented" boilerplate stuff
* non-uniform matrices, unsigned ints
* security bug that was a dupe of one Walter was working on

Mason:
* getting touch events off the main thread - mostly doesn't crash now
* responsive when working
* Jerry with silk - will coordinate, there may be some overlap on this front
