Bas:
* most of the time on clip problem bug (Cairo related, we intersect with the previous clip)

Jeff:
* Skia and text
* listening for the events when the font settings are changed, doesn't seem to work all the time (font smoothing does trigger it, but cleartype off/on does not)

Sotaro:
* memory leak with EGL swap buffers - OGL module is leaking - not sure if QC can fix it or if we should work around it
* WebRTC related stuff
