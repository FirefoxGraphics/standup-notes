Jeff:
* skipping worrying about component alpha, we're only deferring when not copying the background, patch on try
* region padding, a couple of bugs during review comments cleanup

Sotaro:
* tiled layers gralloc free

Nicolas:
* Talked with Bas about the TextureClient stuff from yesterday, he has a very different design proposal (a lot more work but better). postponed the work in bug 1027602 until we have time to talk about these design topics.
* hacky fix for the DXGI race
* Removed the last few places where we create TextureClients and allocate them separately

kats:
* landed stuff for bug 1039979 and bug 1016481 (more touch input block stuff)
* still unable to repro bug 1034240, now because of facebook permissions screen. filed a bug for it
* looking at different options for bug 1038416
* discussion with mchang and tn about hit-testing. realized that our current implementation for APZC can (probably) be improved a lot even without layout-side changes, so i'll try to do that at some point

botond: (PTO today)
  - landed fix for bug 1039822 (security bug about reading FrameMetrics::mContentDescription over IPC)
  - landed fix for bug 1039623 (scroll parent id incorrect for in-process <iframe>)
  - reviewes Kats' patches for bug 1039979 and others
  - bug 1030803 (assertion failure in Axis::ScaleWillOverscrollAmount)
         - wrote a patch that should fix the assertion failure
         - Try push seems to have gotten eaten again due to infra issues
  - bug 1036119 (layers that are both fixed-pos and scrollable)
         - fixed issue in last failing reftest
         - I *think* everything passes now, but couldn't push to Try due to infra issues
  - discovered and filed bug 1040226 (stuck in overscrolled state after scroll handoff)
         - had a theory about the cause (scroll offset update), but it's wrong; will continue to investigate
  - blog post about C++ committee meeting is now finished:
        http://theres-waldo.ca/2014/07/17/trip-report-c-standards-committee-meeting-in-rapperswil-june-2014/
         - not sure why it's not showing up on planet.mozilla.org




BenWa:
* Tested patch for image layer. It works
* Tested Sotaro' patch. Also fixes my problem
* Discuss with tn how memory pressure works
* We are hitting memory pressure for the homescreen icons and throwing images away too aggressively
* We are retaining images we're never going to paint again on the system app
