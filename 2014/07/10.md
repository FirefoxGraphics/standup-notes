* cairo clip bug: the intersection is only correct if the clip is applied with no offset. the offset itself is not passed to the function. offsetting by the target surface's device offset doesn't work (the device offset is always (0,0) when getting the surface out of a clip
* setting the device offset in all of the callers is very invasive (at this point we'd better modify the interface, which is still very invasive)
* looking at whether we could fix this in DrawTargetCairo instead
* looked at 1011348: found where the problem happens, not yet why (cairo/freetype stuff)
* landed bug 1027601
* reviews

BenWa:
* Discussion with devtools regarding profiler/timeline tools
* Landed patch for profiler, and a patch for display items
* Wrote the tiling memory reporter. We have 1MB due to fragmentation on the homescreen.
* Looking into increase homescreen memory usage.

kats:
* backed out bug 1036518 for fennec/b2g regressions
* discussed some bugs (999021, 1036119) with botond
* continued working on bug 1009733, getting closer to how i envision the code should work
* question for the team: how to deal with "Once" gfxPrefs that i want to change in different gtests?

botond:
* landed patch for bug 1031067 [stuck in overscroll after 2-finger pan]
* retested bug 1001214 (unnecessary size changes to background app) to respond to ni? 
* no async scroll / overscroll in Firetext (bug 1036119)
* Kats pointed out this was similar to bug 999021
* after more investigation and discussions with Kats/Timothy, turned out to be a bug in AsyncCompManager's fixed-pos handling
* wrote an attempt at a fix, asked Cwiiis for feedback
* began investigating an issue Mason is experiencing with his input-thread patch queue where overscroll gets stuck after a fling

Sotaro:
* WebRTC help with Gonk native window issue (missing some features that WebRTC needs)
* media codec regression, with camera recording (1.4 only)

Jeff:
* region padding code working, about to ask for review

Bas:
* partial surface upload patches pushed, no complaints so far, though we have theoretical ref test failures (due to the reftest system, we think)
* with Jeff about driver blacklisting bug
