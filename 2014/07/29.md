Bas:
* readback related

Jeff:
* backbuffer eviction.  nstarray memcopying things without copy constructors being called
* regression crash from recent region changes
* Skia e-mail with rounding changes - theyâ€™re pushing back, they have a bad test suite that requires rebasing images

Matt
* D3D9 tiling reftest failures
* Implementing component alpha support for tiles

Nical:
* landed 1041416, 1043929, 1043389
* Bug 985772 (big patch from sotaro that bounced during the uplift): I think I found what's wrong with error checking at least, not sure whether it's normal to get into a situation where we failed to allocate a gralloc buffer in the test suite (and if we did run into that before but when ther error handling was working properly)
* looked some more at Bug 1043426 (D3D11 OMTC crash), getting angry at midly disapointed by microsoft.

BenWa:
* Gaia is making progress on image layer for the background
* Investigating layer culling failures on windows unaccelerated
* Looked at backbuffer expiry failures

kats:
* new fix for bug 1016481 (cancelling click if preventDefault() on touch-end)
* tracked down bug 1020547, was a problem in gaia. patch up for review
* updated patches for bug 1043644, re-testing
* started working on fennec-apz
