BenWa:
* Talking with devtools re streaming performance tool
* Discussed seeming bug with jeff
* Investigated the impacts of will-change on the homescreen and the extra layers. bug 1034347

Nical:
* pushClipToDT bug (1027103) :
* bug 1034584: When a DrawTargetCairo receives a source with an invalid state, the DrawTargetCairo gets into an invalid state as well, which will eventually cause us to crash in gfxContext::PushClipToDT
* Patch r+ed in inbound
* bug 1034593: When we try to paint with a huge clip path, cairo tries to create a huge mask even though the source and destination surfaces are small, fails at it and the pattern gets into an invalid state (leading to the problem above)
* not sure how to fix this properly inside cairo because cairo_surface_t doesn't expose a size
* The two above items happen systematically on google streetview on linux
* need to fix and uplift as much as possible before next monday night (what doesn't get uplifted all the way to beta by then will not be fixed for the next ESR release :(
* landed the last part of bug 1019000
* reviews for sotaro, bjacob, jesup, feedbacks for jgilbert

kats:
* bug 1027851 (blurry text in input fields) turned out to be three separate bugs, so filed bug 1034179 and bug 1034258 for the other two things. landed patches for all three but might need a smaller patch for one of them for uplifting
* landed a fix for bug 1033398 (recomposite while reducing overscroll)
* now looking at bug 1031494 (stretched text in browser pop-up window with low-res turned on)

Sotaro:
* surface stream regression on b2g

Jeff:
* scaled surface bleeding uninitialized data (ugly line at the bottom of the settings app)
* a couple of options to consider

Bas:
* reviews for moz2d conversion, found an unintended change from tiles work (have we lost subpixel AA, and is this related?)
* didn't quite get to capture draw target
