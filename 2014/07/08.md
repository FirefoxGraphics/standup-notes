Nical:
* Fixed bug 1035101 (black h264 video on windows)
* tried different things to reproduce 1015718 with no luck (will try to get a win7 machine to repro)
* looking at another push clip-to-dt related bug (bug 1011348) which seems to be another drawtarget-gets-into-a-bad-state bug which ends up crashing in pushcliptodt, but isn't really related to clips or pushing them per say.

BenWa
* Meeting to debug homescreen being killed
* Looked into innerHeight. Patched that to be double and it fixed our fractional device pixel. But we can't commit it because of web compatiblity

kats:
* landed bug 1035228 to clean up framemetrics logging
* wrote a patch for bug 1035356 which should help mason with his input event work
* spent some time investigating bug 1034376 but was unable to get the root cause. will need more logging and repro it again i think
