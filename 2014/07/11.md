Nical:
* some notes about tuesday's discussion:  https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/design_patterns
* Tried to reproduce windows OMTC flickering issues on a win7 laptop (no luck so far)
* backed out the in-cairo clip patch, landed a fix in CanvasRenderingContext2D
* reviews

BenWa:
* Discussed disagreement with how/when we should evict memory. Had some discussion with jeff, bas and erahmn. I plan on attending the memshrink meeting so we can reach a more official policy
* Investing our gralloc usage. Filed bug 1037154, we no longer discard gralloc buffer when putting the app in the foreground
* Looked into group opacity with jeff

kats:
* landed bug 1036444 to kill off unused touchenter and touchleave event types
* landed bug 1037164 to implement Preferences::SetFloat
* landed bug 1037019 to make some gtests use prefs for touch action instead of polluting production code with an extra flag
* filed bug 1037409 with patch to remove some gtests that don't make sense
* continued working on the state change bug (1009733). got a wip with gtests passing now, will do some manual testing and write more gtests today

botond:
* bug 1036119 (no async scrolling in Firetext app)
* discussed with Chris; my first approach was off the mark
* wrote a more proper patch, reviewed successfully by Chris
* unfortunately, getting some reftest failures, need to look into it
* bug 1034376 (vertical homescreen locking up)
* hard time repro'ing on Nexus 4, including an optimized build
* mght have to do with software home button, as the STR involves focusing movements near the bottom of the screen
* reproduced on Flame; now doing a Flame build so i can debug it
* bug 1037191 (bug in touch event logic related to overscrolling, found by Mason)
* wrote patch, posted for review
* may or may not be the cause of Mason's overscrolling issues

Bas:
* capture draw target
* some subpixel AA related issues in the tests, only non-accelerated cases
* 1036457 - meta bug for OMTC on Aurora

Sotaro:
* camera recording crash, not showing up on Flame, but there on dolphin, will look at it now
* media issue - (Android to shared code with Gonk to deal with this)
* memory leak in shared buffer manager parent, destructor not called

Jeff:
* container layer with intermediate surface is slow, so reordering offscreen and rendering to happen together is what helps us with group opacity animation
* render composite API really helped
* mozilla unique PTR has landed
