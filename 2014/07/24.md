Nical:
* OMTC linux: pulled the recent changes and ran the resftests on my machine, no timeout, a few reftest failures that looked fuzzable. try push https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=c4fa52104505
* The OMTC windows fix apparently improved TResize by 9% and 15%
* patch for bug 1043389
* reviews

kats: (might have to skip today's daily, contractors doing house stuff)
* landed the concurrency fix i stole from jerry, bug 1039159
* helped tn track down more issues with bad layer trees in bug 1041510
* found a bug with clicking things in the browser that is a regression from my bug 1016481, so i backed it out while i think of a better fix
* cleaned up my patch for bug 973096 which seems to improve things in some cases, put it up for review
* put up patches for adding gaia settings for low-precision painting and opacity, bug 1042152
* quick investigations into bug 1042772 and bug 1030711, neither of which appear to be APZ

BenWa:
* Working on the culling patch, waste fragmentation
* Discussed homescreen memory usage, profiler changes for asm.js
* Looked into using cloud VMs for b2g builds

Bas:
* with Matt on clipping

Sotaro:
* codec shutdown problem
* b2g crash, texture client related
* dolphin related crash

Jeff:
* homescreen memory usage, mostly images
* discarding would work, but the limit is high, so we don’t
* images could be discarded by the system, as they’re in volatile memory (4mb), we shouldn't count against the home screen
* the biggest concern is the tiles memory - 10mb (34 tiles allocated, perhaps should be reduced, but not surprising)
