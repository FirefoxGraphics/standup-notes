  - ASAN failures for test for bug 1034376 (stuck on homescreen) on aurora
         - could not repro locally
         - will not spend more time on this: the test was backed out from aurora; the actual fix on aurora, and the test on central, are fine
         - note: ASAN build does not work with clang trunk, only with revision 200213 (Ehsan filed a bug with clang)
  - filed and fixed bug 1039616 (scroll ids missing from layer dump)
  - filed and fixed bug 1039593 (cleaning up TILING_LOG macros)
  - bug 1039822 (security bug about reading FrameMetrics::mContentDescription over IPC)
         - wrote fix, will land today
  - filed bug 1039623 (scroll parent id incorrect for in-process <iframe>)
         - debugged and fixed with Timothy's help, will land today
  - bug 1035598 (overscrolling horizontally shrinks content upward)
         - debugged, discussed with Matt Woodrow
         - general issue with an async-scaling a ContainerLayer that's not at the origin
            - fixing it takes us one step closer to suframe zooming as well
         - Matt suggested a potential fix that involves modifying AsyncCompositionManager;; will try it
  - bug 1036119 (layers that are both fixed-pos and scrollable)
         - fixed the bug that was causing many reftest failures; now have just one remaining



Jeff:
* reftest breakage with reorg - figured out the issue (not simple), will do some investigation now
* working on the padding patch

Nicolas:
* texture client thoughts, please comment on bug 1027602
* patches in progress (e.g., deallocate on the client asynchronously, etc.)
* one of the ways to deal with the windows flickering

Bas:
* connectivity issues
* draw target capture
* some questions about mutating source surfaces in the tiling context

Sotaro:
* memory leaks on B2G
* setting up tests to reproduce, but can't actually take the tests from QC that fail
* QC conference about the complex bug, leak included
* working first on tiled layer not freeing gralloc when it goes in the background

kats:
* relanded bounced patch for bug 1009733, and came up with a different fix for bug 1038930 that stuck
* cleared out a bunch of bugs depending on 1009733:
* landed an old patch to close out bug 995475
* came up with a set of patches to fix bug 1039979 and 1029656
* closed 1030172 as WFM
* have a patch for bug 1016481
* the 2.0 blocker from yesterday (bug 1034240) - i cannot reproduce, requested more info
* tried to help mason with some input event stuff
* some reviews
* a couple of new bugs (1038416, 1038214) have appeared as a result of the 50% opacity on low-res tiles, we may need to back that out and find a new solution

BenWa:
* Discussed how to make the b2g background an image layer with mhenretty
* Looked into memory usage by the system. We spend 2.5 MB on subtle gradient effects. We're asking for these to removed or tweaked.
* Looked at memory logs
