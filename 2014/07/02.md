Nical:
* catching up with emails
* looked at yet another push clips to DT bug
* writing a simple patch to assert everywhere that the gfxContext is in a consistent state (either has a cairo context or a DrawTarget) to definitely rule out null dereference.
* two patches to group texture client creation and allocation (avoid intermediate invalid state)
* Bug squashing party was a great success (although very few people into c++ and even fewer into gfx stuff) ~80 patches over the weekend and several persons came back with new patches afterward
* talked with servo folks about layers and tiling
* filed a bug about jagged borders (had to find a test case that wasn't on a piracy related website)

kats:
* PTO monday; catching up on bugmails and stuff
* Friday: landed some gtests for APZC
* looking at new overscroll/lowres blockers (bug 1031067, 1027851) that came in over the last few days

DanG
* Investigated Chiajung's issue with YCbCr conversion to RGB
* [0, 255, 0] after coding and decoding comes out to [0, 255, 1]
* Found a table of 75% color bars and used the those as reference
* Messed with fraction of 255 values for coefficients to see if I could get something more accurate
* Need a reference implementation because maybe with integer rounding the conversion is lossy.
* Combine vsync + input thread - 998379 

Jerry
* Try to merge input event handling and refresh driver tick() in one ipc message passing.

Mason
* Getting input events off main thread, mostly works for standard cases. Corner cases all break.

Bas:
* capture with Moz2D

Sotaro:
* b2g hard to reproduce bugs, have a speculative patch

Jeff:
* subpixel text issues (subpixel AA breaks Skia reftests)
