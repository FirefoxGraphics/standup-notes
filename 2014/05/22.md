BenWa:
* Looking into ffos webgl performance issues. (Thebes instead of color draw, glViewport, glClear, flush schemantics)
* Landed compositor benchmark patch (but missing a lot of important test cases, will finish these later)
* Better b2g symbolication working! Patch to extend the profiler to use nm if addr2line doesn't return symbols, needed for ffos webgl performance investigation bug 1014382.

Jeff:
* see BenWa's

Sotaro:
* fence objects to compositor, have some leaks to resolve
* buffer management, got r+, but found a issue with HWC, not using OGL composition - in 2.0, we don't use a lot of HWC, so it's difficult to check it
* disabling HWC fixes the issue, so we have to sort it out

kats:
* landed critical displayport changes. any objections to turning on low-precision buffer and progressive rendering?
* started working on bug 1009733. uncovered a pre-existing bug, filed 1014189
* some more work on fennec: the cache2 regression in bug 1013333 and a DDG resizing issue in bug 1014034
* more reviewing of botond's patches
* also will look into bug 999021 today which appears to be a weird layer tree that doesn't play well with APZ

botond
* attended viewing of Munk Debate on state surveillance
* discussion with Kats about transforming input events and preventDefault
* bug 998025 (overscroll effects)
* fixed issue with putting overscrolling behind developer pref
* addressed review comments, fixed a build failure
* have some gtest failures, need to fix

Bas:
* OMTC performance issues
* OMTC perceived performance issues

Nicolas:
* landed "using namespace‚Äù cleanup
* unblocks OMTC OGL patch
* shutdown issues - may have a patch that fixes a big problem and exposes other intermittent ones
* E10S and non-E10S are not shutting down
