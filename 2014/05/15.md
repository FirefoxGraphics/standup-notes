Bas:
* Fixed remaining OMTC failures



sotaro:
* Landed genlock failure fix and fence fix for surfacestream on gonk. They are on inbound
* Worked on media bug and flame specific bugs



BenWa:
* Looked CanvasMark performance on android



kats:
* Wrote some more docs
* Picked up a flame from MoTo and got a build going for it
* Investigated bug 1010119 which julien reported and was causing perma-checkerboarding due to a bad displayport. figured out the cause and have a patch up for review
* Investigated bug 1009162 which turned out to be a dupe of the above
* filed bug 1010979 and have a patch (local testing still) to remove some unneeded code i found while investigating the above
* wrote a refactoring patch for the low-res displayport stuff because the old patches were too hard to review



botond
* landed bug 961289 (APZ testing)!
* will put behind pref as a follow-up
* bug 998025 (overscroll effects)
* implemented interaction between touch events and overscroll, will revise based on kats' feedback

Nical:
* Looked at the omtc test failures
* I have green push for the shutdown sadness 
* bug 1000640: rebased jgilbert's SurfaceStream-omtc-windows patch and made it use ANGLE shared handles whenever possible (rather than readback)



jrmuizel:
* Fixed a bunch of reftests due to rounding and blending problems (some are landed some are not)



Cwiiis:
* Linux OMTC test failure on e10s was caused by patch queue. Moved the XSync to unlock was relying on sync on the platform stuff. The video patch was crashing because it wasn't getting the platform sync.
* Got a windows build environment
