* Bug 1003607 - Rewriting patches to get float texture fix TexSubImage2D to pass review (w jgilbert)
* Epic hg bisect afternoon to track down where https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/sdk/tests/conformance/renderbuffers/framebuffer-object-attachment.html stopped working.

BenWa:
* Looked into the many layer. The first problem is when we share GrallocTextureHost with many ImageHost we recreate the texture + EGLImage every draw. Not sure how to fix yet.
* Added a frames feature for MTC for mattwoodrow
* The other bug is we're calculating the region to recomposite and do 120 region operations
