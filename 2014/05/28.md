Jeff:
* WMW performance, guided workweek to make some changes, will profile with those once we have a new build
* some of our approaches won't do
* native window from Sotaro is the best solution, but very scary for 1.4

Sotaro:
* ANativeWindow, some drawing was incorrect (was missing depth buffer), have a fix
* PTexture shutdown sequence regressed a video, have a patch

botond (Wed May 28):
- landed bug 998025 (overscroll effects)
- overscroll effect backgrounds (bug 1014280)
   - talked to BenWa about background colors
          - BenWa suggested a gray background might look better in the blank areas than the background color of the layer
   - have patches that implement our current approach (background color of the layer)
          - currently for Thebes layers only, plan to generalize to others (e.g. ColorLayers) before posting for review
- while testing overscroll effects, discovered and filed bug 1016682
   - zoom in -> zoom back out leaves page ever so slightly scrollable
   - has always been an issue, but overscroll effects make it noticeable
   - proper solution not immediately clear; see comment 2 for discussion



BenWa:

* filed a couple of bugs w/patches for reftest-analyzer (1016251, 1016260)
* now that printf_stderr is unbusted i will need to spend some time fiddling with AWSY data to re-parse the logs from when it was busted
* still need to prep for bootcamp, have a few more ideas now

DanG:
* Unwind "rabbit hole" refactoring and sorting out the bajillion[1] WebGL2 patches I have spread across MBP and Win7.
* Follow up emails about my proposal to restructure WebGLContext.

[1] technical term.
