DanG: (Monday)
* Working on getting clean patches that apply to Aurora/Beta for Bug 1003607
* When did we start failing https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/sdk/tests/conformance/extensions/webgl-depth-texture.html on nightly?
* Oh, the fix in 1003607 uncovered a bug WRT to depth textures. The -right- behaviour was accidental.
* *grrrr* Our conformance tests aren't catching this :-/
* Worked on refactoring WebGL buffers to support WebGL2 and discuss code changes with :bjacob, :jgilbert and :vlad (Friday) [Haven't found the bottom of the rabbit hole, yet]

BenWa:
* Bug reviews and gpu profiling
* Looked at b2g webgl perf
* Frame sync profiling with an hand held phone: https://bug1015659.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8428321

kats:
* figured out how to run R-oop locally, filed a bunch of bugs to make it easier (hanging off bug 1015222) and fixed one (bug 1015369)
* fixed (bug 1015278) and re-landed the low-res/progressive painting (994293, 897996), is now turned on in central \o/
* landed bug 946879 which disables part of the layer dump unless display list dumping is enabled as well
* will look into the "phantom jog" bug 949859 today, and then get back to bug 1009733 to redo the state changes in APZC

botond
* bug 998025 (overscroll effects)
* one of the gtest failures was due to a memory leak in code that landed in 30, split its fix out into a new bug, landed and requested uplift
* more discussions with Timothy/Matt about exposing background colors to compositor from layout, began implementing
* still waiting for 1 more review (by Vivien, for gaia pref)
* reviewed Kats' patch for bug 1015278 (crash with FrameMetrics sharing)

Jeff:
* draw buffers on clear, why we do it, and how not to do it
* security bug
* BenWa + MWu patch ported to 1.4

Sotaro:
* fence to the compositor patch
* buffer ownership landed
* native window buffer for WebGL patch - seems to be faster

Nicolas:
* file system issues

Bas:
* SVG bug fix
* OMTC fix
* event handling bug, talking to Jim about it
