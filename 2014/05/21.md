kats:
* reviewing botond's overscroll effect patches
* did some more documentation yesterday, putting that on hold for now
* there was a fennec memory regression from cache2, helping track that down in bug 1013333
* low-precision stuff got r+'d, will land that today and let it bake for a day or two before turning it on
* will start working on bug 1009733 shortly, which should help find/fix bugs in content touch interaction

booted
* bug 998025 (overscroll effect)
* worked out some remaining bugs in the visual translation/shrinking effect
* cleaned up patches, posted them for review
* last patch (putting functionality behind a developer pref) not working yet, debugging it

Sotaro:
* media bug, landed
* b2g blockers

Jeff:
* gradient problem with Skia fixed
* css blending failure - fuzzing
* OMTC broke some mask layers

Chris:
* OMTC Linux - green, performance regressions not too bad (if any), improvements nice

Bas:
* SVG bug, path computations
* OMTC appears to have stuck the landing

Jerry
* project silk removes phal protocol done
* checking gallery image preview becomes black when we turn on/off screen. it is not related to webgl context lost problem. we don't lose the context at tarako device now
* rebase deferring webgl context restore when visible bug

Peter:
* image frame constructor crash; got a new STR, will try again
* screenshot issue on 1.4 - 2d canvas game, with SkiaGL, we can't do screenshot in 1.4 - ok on master

* with Chiajung on a draft

Jeff G:
* helping Walter get going
* context lost bug filed, but we already have patches, but stuck on try - could be a driver bug
* surface stream texture host, more or less done - easy fix missing on Mac, failing a couple of B2G
* dynamic texturing proposal response to Chiajung coming up

Dan:
* WebGL2, ES3 shaders support, ANGLE investigations
* mostly related to uniform blocks
* translation of ES3 to GLSL 1.5 on PC ATI going, enough to keep going while waiting for ANGLE to catch up

BenWa:
* Worked on a profiler benchmark suit. Will add tests for TextureEffect with and without gralloc and need a few more upload tests

gw280:
* Think I've finally managed to reproduce bug 913805, so I've been working on fixing that.
