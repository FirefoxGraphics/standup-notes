Nicolas:

Chris:
* Linux OMTC just waiting for one review (24 hours?)
* Android issues: garbage display (offset mistreatment), now progressive rendering issue (offset issue)

Jeff:
* B2G issues (JS callstack unwinding was broken, found the regression patch)
* Profiling Sotaro's fence forwarding (similar results to BenWaâ€™s)
* Utility for measuring touch->WebGL latency

BenWa:
* GPU profiling cost comes from reading gpuclock, asking code aurora
* Fix last frame getting stuck with delay frame patch

kats:
* wrote patches and got r+ for the phantom jog bug (949859), will land it shortly
* spent a bunch of time helping track down the b2g reftest failures that were keeping the tree closed
* eventually it turned out that the low-res/progressive stuff combined with the -enable-oop on emulator reftests caused the problem. the progressive stuff got backed out
* looking through the new failures and diagnosing them. one looks like a legit bug (known issue, which i'm now trying to fix properly). remaining are fuzz or incorrect tests, looks like
* will need to spend some time preparing for the bootcamp next week

botond
* bug 998025 (overscroll effects)
* landed gecko patches on m-i
* gaia patch got r+, sent pull request for it
* implemented part of background color handling, will hopefully finish today
* reviewed a couple of patches for Kats
* talked to Jeff/Ehsan about making quantities more strongly typed
