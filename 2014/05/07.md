kats:
* continued investigations on bug 1005908

* attempting to put together a fix for the EGLImageTargetTexture2D stall, requires learning about opengl which i've managed to avoid thus far
* reviewed botond's big patch queue for the APZ mochitest framework
* did some basic triaging on a few fennec bugs that were sitting in my bugmail
* Bug 859683 bounced (continuing my streak of bouncing patches), need to fix

Jerry:
* rotation performance
* defer webgl context restore - format patch for review

Butter/Silk:
* v-sync is now on a separate thread
* there is a problem in input dispatcher, we need to wait for the event to be sent (say to APZC) and return - APZC is still on the main thread, have to wait a lot
* can't send the v-sync to other modules, so even with a separate thread it's not where it needs to be (yet)
* need to add more tests

jrmuizel:
* skia reftests (bug 1007146 and bug 998042)
