BenWa:
* We found that with tiles aligning code still runs a lot of layout code.
* I wrote testcases for testing the display list behavior
* Various profiling

gw280:
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=960276
* Think I've found what "fixed" the bug upstream - it's most likely due to the landing of this patch which refactored everything https://codereview.chromium.org/18978014
* It's definitely a driver bug on Qualcomm, after tracing through all the code and using apitrace, I can't see anything wrong with the bitmap drawing code
* Further, using GL_RGBA instead of GL_BGRA results in the random line disappearing.
* Never got round to looking at the shadow drawing code unfortunately

botond
* finally landed APZC tree printing!
* composition bounds (bug 935219)
* tried reproing mochitest failures on loaned test machine; running into walls
* did some debugging with vlad about initial displayport sizes
* filed bug 978840
* more testing of Kats' patches for bug 975962 (zooming on overflow:hidden elements), reviewed them
* tree closer bug, touch events not working (bug 978997)
* debugged, identified as regression caused by bug 959847
* tn provided 1-line patch, reopened trees

bjacob
* More work on enabling will-change in privileged code, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=977757 - what remains to be done is hiding the property in the JS objects (i.e. WebIDL) when disabled.
* 15 reviews
* Finalized Gfx IPC fuzzing document https://intranet.mozilla.org/User:Bjacob@mozilla.com/Gfx_IPC_fuzzing , for use by other teams fuzzing their own IPC protocols

Jeff:
* profiling different tiling approaches and scrollbar problem hacked around
* best B2G scrolling profiles ever seen - still a layout issue remaining and unsure if we were using the per tile drawing
* comparing two tiling approaches

Sotaro:
* performance consulting with bkelly, agal
* surface stream object ownership handling

Bas:
* catch up on reviews
* invalidation bugs
* performance in tiling

Chris:
* Android on talos better
* tile pool eviction, edge cases, reworked how much we keep in the cache
* invalidation on single buffer part
* performance comparisons (panning much better)
* can we kill the intermediate draw buffer (eventually)?

Nicolas:
* try pushes results; some crashes remaining, one flavour of Android
* invalidation problems in better shape, scrollbar (Z-index) - wifi panel of settings, sms app (list of discussions), call log, but not the contact app
