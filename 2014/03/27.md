* bug 984490 (input field disappearing in Contacts app)
* prepared reduced test page that demonstrated problem, with BenWa's help
* looked into setting up apitrace on B2G to debug it
* building apitrace for device itself seems to require some updates to build system
* couldn't get emulator to work well enough to repro bug there
* alternatively, trying to debug it through other means
* reviewed bug 982888 patches for Kats

Nicolas:
* accu-weather.  it is fixed, but the patch wasn't in the nightly that was being tested
* contacts app bug (larger than text field, layer disappears) 987219

Chris:
* progressive rendering regression
* some of the rendering code wasn't quite right, except for progressive rendering
* low precision rendering is broken by the tiles (resolution not handled correctly everywhere)

Bas:
* text annotations - print errors (unrelated?)

Sotaro:
* fence handling on tiled layers, on central
* video playback problem, seems to be codec dependents

Jeff:
* HWC composer accu-weather
* not using HWC for full screen YouTube, not a blocker for power
* layered tile decision is done at creation, if conditions change, we don't change our mind - surprised, but not sure if it's actually bad
* we want to fix this during the work week
* tiles in a stack?

BenWa:
* Code reviews for fence, profiler features
* Got the QRD build going
* App startup bug was caused by the debug overlay

kats:
* got both approaches for bug 982888 working, picked the one i feel is better and requested review
* reviewed and landed tn's patches for margins - on central now
