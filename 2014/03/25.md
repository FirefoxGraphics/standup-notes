kats:
* put up patches for bug 982888 which work on an isolated test case. rebased locally, need to test again and request review

* landed a cleanup patch in bug 987314

         - addressed Timothy's reivew comments, posted updated patch
  - bug 976605 (moving touch handlers from BEP.js -> C++)
         - continued working on it

Bas:
* tiles, sorting out why we get into accuweather bug 984618
* don't necessarily need memory pressure
* patch we have doesn't quite fix it
* GDI bug

Nicolas:
* working build, logging the tiling issues
* failures always follow a lot of client side activity without a lot of composition side activity

Chris:
* can't reproduce it anymore, just works now
* no evidence, but patch on 984618 and Sotaro's patch may stop this? except that's not on Hamachi

Sotaro:
* surface descriptor on Gonk native
* flickering problem, patch has feedback+, will be up for review soon for Diego to test

bjacob
* More work on typed enum bitflags (sorry), getting back to Real Work (tm) now
