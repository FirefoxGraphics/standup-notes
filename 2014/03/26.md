gw280:
* Fixed bug 987054 (skia canvas leak)

BenWa:
* Profiled WebGL app with jjylanki
* Profiled slow eather app startup. We're seeing the debug server and the app is doing nothing for 8 second.
* Debugged with botond. Looks like tiling + mask layer doesn't work in some cases
* Setting up QRD but I'm getting 'GitError: platform/vendor/qcom/copper update-ref: fatal: c00f7b650113f6dcdb3792d81866eaad260be404^0: not a valid SHA1'

Jerry:
* bug 974807 - handle webgl lost context
* r?
* bug 983489 - application crashed at gl MakeCurrent() when shutdown
* debuging.
* maybe check the gfxPlatform::Shutdown() as bug 985773
* profile homescreen "restyle" function cost when scroll
* bug 951418 - trace-viewer porting for firefox

Dan:
* JS apps to test WebGL performance
* how many draw calls can we get and keep 60 fps
* use to profile WebGL efficiency
* intermittent WebGL conformance test failures (not a lot of good news yet, no local STR)
* work week - plans for WebGL2

Sotaro:
* fence handling on tiled layers bug
* final review, then land

Nicolas:
* HR took them away for four hours todayâ€¦
* following up the left over problems from accuweather bug

Bas:
* accuweather bug
* SVG Moz2D-fication help

Chris:
* Android progressive rendering
* "render layer buffer" in tiled content host seem to need help with progressive rendering

Jrmuizel:
* Fought my computer to keep it from turning off, got ergo assesed
* Looked at per-tile-painting reftest failures (bug 988066)
* Looked at debug reftests on b2g emulator
* Broke all the trees by asking for win8 driver update

kats:
* approach #1 for bug 982888 didn't work, so tried approach #2. that didn't work either.
* now trying approach #3, which is a variant on approach #1

botond
* discussed bug 982888 with Kats
* continued working on bug 976605 (BEP.js -> C++)
* original approach did not work, had to change tack and try different approach
* investigated bug 984490 (input field disappearing in Contacts app)
* looks like some interaction between tiling and mask layers/intermediate surfaces
