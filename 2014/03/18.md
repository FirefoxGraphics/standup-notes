* WebGL WG getting serious about drawElements performance, NVIDIA contributing a benchmark https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL/pull/501 specifically hitting the one corner case where we suck
* Got a patch to not suck https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=984783
* Dozen reviews for mstange on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=984761
* Removing possibly unneeded D2D/D3D10 blacklist rules https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=984417 to get the green curve up on http://people.mozilla.org/~bjacob/gfx_features_stats/ . This matters also because without D3D10 we dont get fast WebGL (the D3D9 path has to read back frames).
