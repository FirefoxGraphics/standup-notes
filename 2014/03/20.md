Nicolas:
* Tiling problem bug, but there is a build problem
* Can't reproduce in an older build, no issues, perhaps a recent regression

Chris:
* Android vanishing content
* Same bug as Nicolas - texture client deferred?  We don't check if it's unlocked, perhaps that's the issue

Sotaro:
* removing surface descriptor on gonk
* works on ICS
* now to work on JB
* video playback regression on master
* camera recording bug, non-atomic counter

Bas:
* SVG regression from Moz2D (path flattening, now fixed)
* recording
* XP text bug with annotations

botond
* bug 982141 (initial displayport for subframes)
* implemented latest approach, patches awaiting review
* looked at Chris' patch for bug 983208 (vanishing content on android), provided feedback
* rebased Kats' patch for bug 980679 for 1.3 uplift
* bug 984673 (white area at bottom of the page)
* investigated "temporary white" issue, seems normal
* "permanent white" issue is difficult to reproduce, happens only with tiling on, looks like displayport is too small but hard to say why, continuing to investigate

kats:
* was on PTO, now catching up. read most/all bugmail, still need to deal with reviews
* will look at bug 980679's regression and try to get it relanded
* also need to fix bug 984548, fennec regression from overflow:hidden changes in B2G
