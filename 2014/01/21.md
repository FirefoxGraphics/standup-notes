Nical:
* Fixed component alpha with new ContentClient/Host
* Now wroking on getting new ContentClient/Host on windows, locking is good, but some objects are keeping references to DrawTarget longer than they should, leading to crashes
* I have some talos results for new textures on windows in bug 957560, what tools do we have to compare the two pushes?



botond
* further debugged Fennec checkerboarding regression caused by bug 959847
* had discussion with Timothy
* Timothy's working on a patch
* rebased composition bounds patch (bug 935219), tested it on B2G and Fennec
* ok on B2G, hard to tell on Fennec due to above regression

bjacob
* More https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=940842
* Ran into issue in CSS tests: some tests depending on prefs to enable CSS properties, do not do anything, because the properties list is loaded before the pref is set!
* Because of that, silently regressed own patch.
* Other than fixing that, mostly done.
