BenWa:
* patches to port the FPS counter to windows and composite full-tilt (like a video game)
* D3D9 performance: http://people.mozilla.org/~bgirard/cleopatra/#report=37bb5aa6391fd039803bfd583cd31482733b2e32
* PTO today

botond
* continuing to investigate bug 962791 with Timothy's help (cancel button disappearing)
* we have a theory of what's causing the problem, need to test it
* waiting on 2 more reviews to land APZC tree logging

Chris:
* memory pool for tiles - should do the work on the new textures
* do gralloc stuff first

kats:
* went through a handful of bugs to repro/test what the current state is: bug 963852, bug 963584, bug 963310, bug 959393, bug 946502, etc.
* discussed with malini stuff about testing on b2g now that apz is enabled.
* reviews, interview, more digging around on bug 957668 for displayport changes

Nical:
* 17 reviews \o/
* I have the D3D11 new ContentClient figured out, but it will need whatever perf improvement Bas is doing on the deprecated one
* D3D9 is still borked with ContentClient, looking into it
* A patch for bug 959615 that might need to be uplifted all the way to beta :( - Mac crash

Bas:
* D3D10, tests on try, to see what the causes are, get more information.
* For example, drawing everything 50 times, the numbers are weird (comparing MTC and OMTC).  Tests with scrollbars, higher overhead
* caching the surfaces optimizations

bjacob
* Started work on Gfx IPC hardening by getting Faulty to run on desktop linux with OMTC layers for initial quick iteration;
* Filed some bugs already, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=963790
* Some have patch, some are being discussed with Ben Turner (do we want asserts to allow child process to crash parent process with DEBUG?)
* Did math for Matt Woodrow for CSS 3D transforms bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=952011  (back-transforming a rect by a projective transform is nontrivial).

Jeff:
* Collabora meeting
* FontContainers reviewed, not landed yet
* WiFi display on Android

Sotaro:
* Fence blocking
* 1.3 regression on 4.3, have a temporary patch

George:
* same reftest crap as usual :( going to try and work together with snorp today to determine what the hell we can do to try and debug it)
