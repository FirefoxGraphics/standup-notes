BenWa:
* Configured fennec environment for GalaxyTab bug, looking into the bug
* Catching up on needinfo
* Had a discussion with mchang re: scrollgraph vs. a gaia regression test
* Looked into the keyboard issue flashing black on close

Nical
* carreer fair: no gfx gurus, maybe some good students for other teams
* reviews, needinfos

botond
* investigated remaining issue for keyboard hiding bug (bug 959198)
* wrote Gecko patch to have APZ respect 'mozpasspointerevents'
* wrote prototype Gaia patch to turn on APZ in keyboard app
* together they fix the problem
* need to write proper Gaia patch
* reviewed patches by Kats, BenWa
* tested Timothy's patches for bug 959847 (prerequisite for comp bounds patch)
* ok on B2G, Metro
* regresses checkerboarding on Fennec, need to look into it
* began thinking about integrating my logging utility with Bas'

Bas:
* D3D9 layer manager, fixing some deprecated textures code.  tart is now on par, slight improvement with Jeff's "trick"
* tscroll is withing 20%, could be the stoppage of StretchRect tricks
* some opacity benchmarks regress significantly

Sotaro:
* patch for the video flickering, waiting on the review
* content client in gonk, crash remaining during scrolling, looking for a cause

Chris:
* apzc bugs 958549, not that obvious

George:
* test failures with Skia rebase on build-bot
* finalizing the Flash text rendering on Android

Jeff:
* DDBs not drawn to useful places; patch to not use DDBs when using DX9, but not an easy patch to do; may just not use them at all

kats:
* landed patches for bug 941138 which i had lying around for a long time (mostly cleanup)
* landed patch for bug 936008 which is an android topcrash in code i own
* got a log from vivien for bug 947337 so now i understand what's going on there. need to figure out a proper fix for it
* continued working on bug 957668, making reasonable progress but i haven't tried running the code yet
* tracking down other gaia mozbrowser frames which need APZ enabled (filed bug 961047 and linked deps)
* put up a patch for bug 845690 (console log for when we hit the implicit backwards-compatible meta-viewport code path)
* reviewed Cwiiis' dynamic toolbar patch (security issue)
* threw together a patch for bug 941995 for B2G+Fennec (removing double-tap latency in more cases)

bjacob
* About done on will-change https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=940842 , failures only on non-OMTC basic layers, might not matter?
