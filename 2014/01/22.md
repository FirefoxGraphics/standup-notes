BenWa:
* Landed fullscreen bug
* Discussed profiler changes with CJ
* Scoped changes to increase the circular buffer efficiently for low memory devices
* Seeing some bugs with APZC because our DisplayPort is too big

botond
* final round of review for fullscreen bug
* also wrote patch for it
* more testing of composition bounds patch
* tested on metro, ran into issues likely caused by underlying bug 959847 issues
* fixed a crash in layer dumping code
* wrote enhancements to gfx logging utility, up for review

Nical:
* bug 947213: haven't been able to repro on Linux and Windows yet, made a patch that should avoid the crash but I don't know what led us to the invalid state that crashes.
* bug 957560: If no-one objects I'll make new textures the default on windows today
* bug 946200: ContentClient now passes the lock/unlock assertions and doesn't keep draw targets longer than the valid time anymore, still crashing in D2D though, investigating.
* landed the fix for bug 959615, will most likely have to uplift if it does fix the crash

kats:
* interview, some reviews and bug-mentoring, much IRC discussion, responding to preeti's incessant needinfos
* landed patches for bug 947337 but they bounced because i forgot to update tests. did that, pending review
* more work on bug 957668 (not as much as i hoped yesterday, but getting somewhere today)

Sotaro:
* gralloc deallocation/binder
* fence blocking on trunk

bjacob:
* More will-change, all done and working except for UNEXPECTED-PASS on WinXP, looking into that.

Jeff:
* customize mode performace issue with Australis

Chris:
* patch for the apzc blocker with settings app (gaia team also has a bug in there) (bugs 958549, 962058)
* Finishing bugs 961712, 960146
* tiling summary

Bas:
* D3D9 OMTC - GetDC and UpdateSurface

Nicolas:
* e10s - can't reproduce, but have a fix that should remove the crash, but we don't know why it would happen
* content client/host new textures work
------------------------------



Jerry
* Bug 945082 - lockscreen fade-out animation is still < 60fps
* try to remove intermediate surface when compose a container with alpha value
* can't pass the retest

Dan
* regression webgl issues, one was a bug in the test
* random security issues

Morris
* Persistent data in layer scope, have a prototype
* all the data goes into a single file, so it gets too large (1MB/frame) - will isolate the image data to reduce the size
* shader refactoring (6 shaders bug)

JeffG
* tracking down reftest failures
* review for frame buffer completeness uncovered some ugly nasty code, cleaning it up - more asserts, etc.

Matt
* 8000 emails to go through

Nick
* looking at optimizing OMTC on D3D11; Bas picked up D3D9.
* With D3D11, even some regressions, nothing obvious in the profile
* CSS images work
