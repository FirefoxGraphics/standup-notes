Morris
* Bug 959114 - [LayerScope] Easy connection between device and viewer
* Convert native socket to websocket

Dan
* depth textures patch, landed
* bug with layer scope (keyboard texture capture incorrectly)
* MozSurface early discussions

Nick:
* bugs cleanup (PGO only crash have a patch, buffer rotation related diagnosed)
* css images 
* sync image decoding part failing a few tests

Jerry:
* launch screen performance
* find some cases where we can remove temp surface, have a patch
* still need to modify gaia side, css rule was generating temp surface - partnering with Gaia to sort this out

gw280:
* Rebase procedure documented for Skia
* Filed bug 965088 after finding out the nvidia drivers used on the emulator testbots are from 2009
* Still trying to debug tbpl failures with Skia update. Looking likely to be driver related

Nical:
* fixed D3D9 TextureHost, now new textures + new ContentClient work on D3D9 and D3D11
* Need to port one of Bas's perf improvement over the the new D3D9 textures (Bug 965096)

BenWa:
* Interviewed intern candidate
* Looked into getting CSS left position fix for cleo
* D3D9 performance

botond
* revised and landed bug 962791 (cancel button hiding)
* tested some things on b2g for nrc for e.me privacy page overlapping bug
* reviewed small patches for drs
* looked briefly into bug 956802 (subframe zoom becomes out of sync with document zoom)
* difficult to debug due to memory exhaustion issues, should be easier after bug 957668 (new displayport representation) is fixed
* resumed work on dynamic toolbar
* ran into and filed a couple of bugs in App Manager (bug 965000, bug 965047)
* ran into B2G crash, filed bug 964976

* APZC tree logging waiting for 2 reviews by Bas

kats:
* got some logging from bug 956690 which :tn was able to diagnose - i have a patch that works now
* continued working on bug 957668, wrote a mochitest to exercise the code in isolation and debug it on mac desktop which is much easier. seems to be working now, going to put it back on a b2g device and see how it fares
* finished up writing tests for the fuzzy-equals function but hitting a strange compile error on OS X on try. gonna try reproducing locally

Chris:
* FOSDEM talk preparation

Bas:
* FOSDEM talk preparation
* OMTC D3D11 performance
