botond
* looked into some gaia-apzc regressions
* bug 951412 - issue where mlb.com was not pannable --> turned out to be an evangelism issue (site has improper meta-viewport tag)
* bug 951375 - FTE screens not being scrollable --> due to APZ hit testing not using touch-sensitive regions yet --> gaia workaround needed for now

sotaro

cwiiis:
* 950993 - position fixed and apzc

bjacob
* Looked at canvasmark regression on osx 10.6 , verified it's caused by PTexture and doesn't happen outside of osx 10.6  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=950113
* Figured out crasher https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=943925 , was a bug in how we loaded the glDrawBuffers symbol
* been preparing a patchset to switch Thebes to typed enums

Nical:
* I have a patch for bug 952507 (ContentClient locking) which fixes the single buffered version, now working on the double-buffered case

Jeff:
* imagelib moz2d - datasource sub surface to match gfximage sub surface - the challenge is that we promote to opaque, as we don't track things in both cases

Bas:
* Moz2D should be up to date, not sure if it builds on the Mac
* finished the glyph extents patch, need the Mac variant
