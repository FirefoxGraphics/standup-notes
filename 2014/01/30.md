bjacob:
* will change landed
* IPC security work
* some create image API

Sotaro:
* Different B2G bugs, not a lot of progress

Jeff:
* bjacob's GL bugs
* MozSurface on "other" platforms
* getting a slave, had trouble yesterday

gw280:
* Testing some potential fixes for the try failure, but not holding out hope, so still trying to reproduce the issue locally

kats:
* landed patch for bug 956690 to fix the metro page blanking out
* found what seems to be a compiler or buildenv problem on OS X, filed a bug
* dealing with APZ-gaia fires (some test failures due to APZ are being tickled by enabling NUWA, various other 1.3+ bugs)

botond
* posted patch to "fix" bottom toolbar not showing on Nexus 4 (bug 965055)
* looked into what needs to be done for dynamic toolbar
* not showing a scrollbar for the div grouping the toolbar and the iframe - need to have discussion with roc about a possible new css property to control this
* text overlapping bug in AccuWeather app (bug 964517)

BenWa:
* fps target on the compositor, useful for performance testing
* D3D9 code
* to the layer dump, add some extra information

Bas:
* FOSDEM presentation
* removing sync does lower the regression, but not enough - just slightly less bad; 10-ish% becomes about 5-ish%.  Not an option to do this, but wanted to see what it was

Chris:
* FOSDEM talk
* tiling with BenWa

Nicolas:
* D3D9 optimizations with new textures
* new textures on linux when in OMTC
* deprecated textures pref should now be ignored on OpenGL platforms - there would be no way to switch back to them anymore
