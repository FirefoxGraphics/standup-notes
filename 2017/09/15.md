* whatsapp svg issue (1398697)
* tried to make width of snapped rects constant (by rounding left, top, width, and height, instead of left, top, right, and bottom). lots of test failures.
* maybe I need to changing snapping in lots of other function too, or maybe this is the wrong approach



kats (will miss daily, dentist appt):
* filed bug 1400034 for doing a better job with the scaling/transforms, looking into the original test failure that led us down this path
* bunch of triaging of bugs
* spent a bit of time looking into bug 1399850, WR crash
* more position:sticky work



nical
* landing stuff, getting backed out, fixing, relanding...
* fun floating point precision bug
* updated some of the wr doc



kvark
* bit of WR reviews
* WebGPU + Servo:
* creating https://github.com/kvark/webgpu-servo
* buffer data uploads
* buffer & image creation
* looking into descriptor heaps a bit more

* bug 1389021 (compositor thread shutdown hang) -- fix landed, seems to be sticking, requested uplift to beta
* bug 1397214 (InitAcceleration crash) -- finishing going through the pushlog, nothing obvious from potentially related changes which is bad, putting together a fix although it is tricky because the observer service doesn't seem to get created before ContentChild is created (and the first message we get is the one we are crashing in)
* bug 1382783 (use IO thread instead of main thread for IO for chrome/blob URIs) -- put patch up for review
