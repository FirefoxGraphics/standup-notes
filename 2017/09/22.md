* bug 1400637 (ImageBridgeParent::InitForContent / gfxPlatform::InitAcceleration crash)
* pointed out the sandboxing change from the pushlog, it was confirmed to be the root cause, off my plate now :D
* bug 1401524 (ImageSurfaceCache::SuggestedSize crash, round 2) -- landed the fix for this
* bug 1389759 (MessageChannel::CommonThreadOpenInit crash) -- patch in progress, just a guess but I think it somehow incorrectly marked the same process CompositorManagerChild instance as unusable

gankro
* implemented full native TextOverflow (in review)
* cleaned up TextDrawTarget significantly (same review)
* fixed up "don't make a real DrawTarget for TextDrawTarget" (based on same patch set)



kats:
* failed to turn on layers-free by default, too much intermittent
* made progress on the taskcluster CI for webrender
* landed two WR updates (had to split the update into half to get around infra restrictions and minimize risk of backout)
* overall hampered by decision task failures on many try pushes due to something gps did



mstange
* filed webrender bugs with testcases
