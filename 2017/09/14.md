aosmond
* bug 1389021 (compositor thread shutdown hang)
* crash annotations in the first few crash reports received thus far demonstrate that it is indeed the content processes that are keeping the compositor thread alive
* landed patch which should resolve this by forcing the shutdown to happen in the parent process
* bug 1397214 (gfxPlatform::InitAcceleration crash)
* going through the push log to weed out unlikely changes (down to ~1/4 thus far); content process looks to be shut down early before we finish startup so to speak, easy to work around just want to see if something changed the ordering or allowed early exit first



rhunt

* looking at ClientTiledPaintedLayer for OMTP
* looking into dumping DrawTargetCapture commands

kats:
* landed WR update
