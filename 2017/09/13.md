jnicol
* figured out whatsapp continually repainting 1398697
* working on fix shouldn't be too complicated



kvark
* VkPortability C bindings: device creation
* WebGPU + Servo: more graphics pipeline states



nical
* trying to reland the removal of the gfx job scheduler
* more wr transaction stuff
* the bulk of the architecture/refactoring stuff is there now
* we still have problems with some display items using the image bridge whereas they should be in transaction
* added a way to see the alpha primitive rects in webrender, exposed in wrench, samples and the debug server.
* useful to understand what breaks batches if there are performance issues related to many alpha batches
* patch to fix crash related to image being deallocated too early in bug 1397407
* I think that fonts will need something similar
