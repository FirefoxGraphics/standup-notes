jnicol
* working on new approach for whatsapp issue
* make the surfacecache allow size to be out by 1 if full
* speculative patch up for review on security crash



nical
* did not work on shutdown stuff :)
* worked on ipc stuff :(
* the IpcResourceUpdateQueue with its fixed size shmem segments blows up the fd limit with some very large blob images
* added a separate list of dedicated shmems for large allocs
* we have some places where image keys are created and destroyed in the same transaction, and that causes issues
* my "fix" is to delay deleting images by one transaction
* it sucks for memory usage, we need to fix the root of these creation/deletion pairs but it works around the issue in the short term.
* confused about the behavior after IPC_FAIL
* we at least process the next message which can cause us to crash if a resource that should have been added in the failed transaction is referred to



jrmuizel
* Friday webrender profiling and bug filling



kvark
* Vk Portability:

aosmond
* so much fail in one weekend
* bug 1389021 (compositor thread shutdown hang)
* got backed out of release because of reftest shutdown issues in debug builds
* because it got backed out of release, they backed it out of central for the known leakcheck issue on debug
* looking into how to salvage this
* bug 1380649 (gmail icons disappear)
* landed that diagnostic patch. generated 10k crash reports in a single build for this, when I was expecting a few dozen at most. ~200 on Windows, ~2200 on Mac, and ~8100 on Android.
* the good news is I was able to put up patches fixing the problem based on the stack traces
* bug 1397214 (gfxPlatform::InitAcceleration crash)
* the shutdown canary worked but moved the crash to further down the chain; need to write part 2 and see if that sticks



lee

* investigating FreeType 2.8.1 LCD rendering issue



mchang

* it sounds like checkerboarding
* looking into bug 1333056 (content process crash in gfxPrefs::AssertSanity
* for some reason my windows builds are crashing on startup



kats:
* found a solution for the transforms problem - just delete all the code. landed that in bug 1400034. i also turned on layers-free for transform/ and transform-3d/ reftests but there's some intermittent failures so i'll back out that part



mstange
* PTO on Friday
