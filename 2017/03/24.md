kvark
* WR PR reviews and opaque split optimization

nical
* blob image renderer gecko integration

* (hopefully) fixed an intermittent failure



rhunt
* Got a PR for normalizing gradient stops, along with lots of reftests, for WR ready
* Noticed we weren't treating gradient stop colors as premultiplied alpha in WR - put up a PR but it needs more work for the aligned shader
* Fixed a couple reftests on wrench that were merged with underscores still



aosmond
* improved gtest reftest equivalent, got more tests working with it



kats:
* added override prefs in bug 1349949 so now we just have one pref that needs flipping to get webrender properly enabled in nightly
* dealing with fallout from building webrender by default (linux libGL link errors in bug 1349967, windows cross-compiling errors in bug 1350001)
* landed crashtest fix in bug 1335745



botond:
