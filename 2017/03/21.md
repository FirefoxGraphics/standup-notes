Short meeting this week:


- Jerry is continuing his work on getting MacIOSurface to work in WebRender.
- Sotaro has made good progress on ANGLE in WebRender and started working on the pipeline-per-video integration.
- Nical is working on tiled images and blob images in webrender and the plumbing required to render into a blob image using Moz2D.



We also discussed whether we should get WebRender to associate one image key for the triplet of Y, U and V planes (instead of a key per plane as it does currently). Our sentiment is that it would be less error prone and would facilitate gecko integration (the latter bundles the 3 textures in one logical TextureClient/Host), however it would make things a bit more complicated in the resource cache (probably not too much). This discussion will continue in a github issue.
