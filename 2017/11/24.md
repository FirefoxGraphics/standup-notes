nical
* Had a look at scene buliding during video playback
* our work to avoid it seems to work in simple cases, in youtube we keep rebuilding the scenes though, not sure why yet
* we sometimes build it several times
* trying to disentangle things that hold on to IPDL actors to allocate shared memory from things that just need to know about simple things like the backend
* it is a horrible mess right now, things that are not thread safe get used from media thread and we don't really notice when looking at the code because it is buried in abstractions.
