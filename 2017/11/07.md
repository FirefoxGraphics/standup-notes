jnicol
* on train to paris for rust training



kvark
* WR reviews
* catching up on emails
* GPUWeb resource updates



nical
* looking into dotted corner bug in webrender
* found the issue, have a fix
* the result is a bit disappointing though, because the dots can overlap in some cases
* if we want to avoid that we need to rethink the way dots are generated (currently pretty naive) 



lee
* landed WR font descriptors
* tracked down possible Cairo font race in blob image



jrmuizel
* blob image invalidation debugging
* investigation into large fallback in the chrome
* some webrender performance investigation
* added property binding support to wrench



aosmond
* bug 1415085 (imagelib cache asan treeherder failure) -- very simple problem, although it took some code staring to realize where it went wrong, wrote/landed fix for this
* bug 1413011 (compositor thread shutdown crash) -- landed fix
* bug 1414762 -- landed fix
* bug pending -- looking into uninitialized process token w/ CompositorManagerChild
* continued AsyncImagePipelineManager rework



kats:
* more thinking about hit-testing. starting to carve out pieces that i can land independently ahead of the main change
* landed WR update, put the remaining gecko sticky patches up for review



rhunt
* Investigating OMTP copy buffers assertion
* resulting from a change that allowed front and back buffers to have different sizes
* this causes multiple issues in the existing code
* have an easy fix that will revert to the previous behavior
