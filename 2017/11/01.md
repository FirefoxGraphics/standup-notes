jnicol
* investigating some surfacetexture tiling problems
* seems pretty stable - no crashes or hangs - but some black tiles



dvander (missing call for halloween things)
* finally landed bug 1395478 (omtp box shadows and more)
* landed bug 1411804 (talos test for display list perf)
* next, working on bug 1397310 and making RGBALuminanceOp omtp-ready



Michael
* probably reduce lots of WebGL intermittent failures on windows 7
* pagefile was created for windows 7 testing machines
* one crash at ANGEL after pagefile configuration

Daosheng
* WebGL2.0 gpu instancing crashes on Windows

Jerry
* Export gfxCriticalNote/Error to WR
* work on SyncObject crash because of device reset for video

Ethan
* Help Retained display list
* land SVG fallback perf improvement

Morris
* Improve blur in WR
* check blur effect in FB

Peter
* box-shadow perf with the integrated GPU on windows



Sotaro
* Fixed webrender canvas and video related bugs



kats:
* landed fixes for some fallback bugs, mostly we were doing silly things (bug 1413229, bug 1407752, bug 1407749)



aosmond
* bug 1404422 (document load group stalled) -- landed on inbound
* bug 1413011 (new compositor thread shutdown crash)
* the unused compositor thread (has GPU process) state is wonky and breaks shutdown in the UI process
* specifically affects 56.0+ release, 57 beta and 58 nightly (maybe something that was uplifted to 57 beta and 56.0 is causing it or made it more likely...)
* some work on the AsyncImagePipelineManager refactor



botond [in an interview, will not make call]
* wrote up evaluation for intern candidate 
* bug 951793 (scroll-boundary-behavior) 
* debugging the implementation (also ran into and helped roc debug some rr issues along the way) 
* reviews: bug 1413227



lee
* WR font odyssey



rhunt
* clean up and testing of OMTP buffer copying patches
* posted for review
* investigating adding test for the regression I caused



gankro
* significantly reworked the enum RFC for feedback
* repr(int) now is a union(tag, payload) form used today by Rust
* repr(C) requests the (tag, union(payload)) layout
* tests, some open questions



jrmuizel
* came up with plans for text serialization performance improvements with Gankro
* more work on blob invalidation/grouping
* investigated another crasher that I introduced with the font sharing



mstange
* finished working out the mask for subpixel text on transparent backgrounds with font smoothing background color
* wrote a patch that implements it in WR
* wrote a long document describing how text blending works
