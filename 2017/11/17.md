aosmond
* bug 1368776 (scaled image containers) -- landed \o/
* fixed a trivial bug causing all but 3 of my remaining reftest failures when combined with bug 1183378
* bug 1366097 (vector image containers) -- reworking based on review feedback, should be more or less complete now
* bug 1183378 (integrated scaled containers with WR)
* this is where my remaining test failures are (I think)
* the SVG failure is due to ComputeSnappedImageDrawingParameters adding more parameters to the SVGImageContext that I don't add on the WR path
* the raster failure I'm speculating is due to ComputeSnappedImageDrawingParameters calculating a slightly different value than my ComputeSizeForDecode
* the third failure produces the same results locally with nightly for me, so I'm ignoring it for now :)



jnicol
* surfacetextures - definitely are leaking fds but not memory
* 1417310 - animated transforms layerisation oom - have old patch which would have almost fixed this, but is now complicated by retained display lists

* WR update
* getting second round of hit-testing patches up for review
