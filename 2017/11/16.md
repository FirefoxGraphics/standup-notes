nical
* patch to not clip native themed items to avoid overinvalidation
* managed to get a repro of the mastodon emoji craze on a computer that can build gecko, looking into it
* chased down people about the 57 first run page that achieves a glorious 3fps on basic compositor
* 1417888 - The 57 first run page can't run smoothly without GPU compositing.



jnicol
* surfacetexture leak (or is it?)
* looked at insane testcase which allocates lots of big layers



kvark
* WR reviews, finishing up the query refactor
* WebGPU: discussions, conf call



aosmond
* posted updated image container patches fixing a few bugs; the missing SVG context info fixed a lot of failing reftests (and the chrome icons), but still some failing, investigating
* also found vector images aren't being properly put into shared surfaces, and even if we do, those surfaces aren't always put into the image container, need to fix that
* landed the fix to make shared surfaces reuse their image key as much as possible
* there are still some potential improvements in RasterImage::UpdateImageContainer (which causes the image key to get updated) to explore to minimize key churn



jrmuizel
* mostly motionmark bug filing and diagnosing



rhunt
* omtp copy buffer crash
* very odd test page, creating ~100-1000 painted layers
* i think there's resource exhaustion happening
* omtp graphic corruption
* related to double buffering, i think i've found the cause



kats:
* put up round 1 of patches for hit-testing for review
* discussion with david bokan, mstange, botond about visual viewport stuff. got enough agreement to start implementing some things but there's still some other things we need to agree on
* more searchfox hacking



gankro
* some serde
* mostly pushing forward binary float parsing in the rust community
