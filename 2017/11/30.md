nical
* investigating APZ issue with webrender (1415272)
* while scrolling we continuously rebuild the display list (I expected we would kinda regularly do that but not at 60fps) it's not great
* the other day while staring at shaders in RenderDoc I stumbled upon discard instructions inserted (by ANGLE i assume) on Windows
* worth looking into whether that's the same kind of discard that blows up early-z and other optims 



aosmond
* bug 1420648 (fuzzy smilies on twitter) -- traced it to a rounding difference with fallback; copied the calculation exactly as it was, no longer fuzzy, patch up for review today
