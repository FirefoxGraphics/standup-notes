kvark
* Szeged call
* WR reviews
* WR type enforced color premultiplication



aosmond
* bug 1183378 (integrate scaled image containers with WR) -- wrote initial patches, still some kinks to work out
* bug 1401672 (don't duplicate ImageKeys) -- wrote initial patch, now testing



gankro
* helping rust team draft up explanation/rfc for saturating casts
* good progress on serde, nearly done deriving structs



nical
* landed the patch to not use blob images for stuff that is faster to draw on the content side
* scrollbars and check boxes should be yellow when painted content is highlighted now
* looking at webrender optimizations that are not depending on glenn's primitive run refactoring
* picked up alpha batching, experimenting with it
* we don't try to reuse images for a lot of repeated stuff like check boxes
* today was supposed to be a holiday but i forgot



rhunt
* landed omtp copy buffers
* omtp copy buffers backed out for intermittent not seen on my try run
* fixed the intermittent
* pushed omtp copy buffers again
* fixed a few cbindgen things in between



lee
* investigated Skia/D2D contrast settings
* working on WR glyph transforms



kats:
* looked at some optimizations for motionmark
* continued working on hit-testing, minimizing the set of frames. made some progress but i need a different framework because event regions are per-layer and really we care about per-scrollframe information
* landed WR update



jrmuizel
* motionmark perf
* blob invalidation painting now works
