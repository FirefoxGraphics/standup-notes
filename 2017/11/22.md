    bug 1419767 (put SVGs in data surfaces on Linux and/or WR) -- reworked patch originally in bug 1183378, will be up for review today

    finished work to reduce the churn of updating image containers unnecessarily



    now reworking SharedSurfacesChild to manage image key lifetime per surface rather than per container (bad if the same surface is in multiple containers!)
