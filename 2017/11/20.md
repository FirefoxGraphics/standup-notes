nical
* patch to render common bullet items with webrender instead of blob images
* having issues with profiling on windows
* looking at plumbing some missing wr debugging tools into gecko



aosmond
* scaling image container *support* for raster and vector images now in nightly
* bug 1183378 (make WR *use* scaled image containers)
* did some patch reworking to incorporate the fix for the SVG reftest failure
* still investigating those last two reftest failures; strangely it does not seem related to scaled containers in of itself, since it uses the same size without my changes
* did some preliminary MotionMark testing -- seems to help significantly, ahead of baseline/current WR Firefox for the cases I tried, but still behind Chrome :(



lee
* thread-safety issue with blob image fonts
* WR font transforms



rhunt

botond
