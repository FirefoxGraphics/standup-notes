* bug 1363347 (WR + youtube fullscreen -> crash)
* rust panic was misleading, just a consequence of a bug in external image IDs
* async/video compositable handles are shared rather than unique to a layer, and a new layer using it can be created before the old gets deleted (very short gap), but we currently assume single owner
* created patch to allow multiple external image ID mappings to the handle if owned by the same WRBP
* bug 1365009 (reinit crash, fallout from bug 1363347)
* just another attempts-IPC-after-other-process-lost, landed patch for this
