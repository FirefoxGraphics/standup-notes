kats:
* helped Alexis figure out the reftest failures with the WR update
* started moving to new house
* filed an issue about scrollbars in WR
* backed out stuff to see if it fixes checkerboarding regression



jrmuizel
* chasing a blob image reftest failure (boo rr assertions) (also rust debug builds seem to be not so debugable...?)
* tried to figure out why rls was broken (upstream broke it)
* tried to get code coverage working for webrender. failed (kcov segfaults)



botond
* mentored bug 1354185: reviewed and landed 
* looked into a couple of issues reported by Ovidiu while verifying scrollbar dragging fixes 
* a remaining issue in the testcase for bug 1359868 (incomplete painting of scrollbar thumb after being partially offscreen) 
* initially thought it was Mac-specific, built Firefox on Mac and investigated 
* turns out it affects all platforms; filed bug 1363219 with a fix 
* an issue on Google Sheets (bug 1326290) 
* the described behaviour is expected (caused by Sheets snapping the scroll position to the nearest cell boundary) 
* investigating bug 1362889 (regression in the behaviour of APZ GTests) 
* bisected to find regressing commit; investigated, have a fix up for review 
* reviews: bug 1363123
