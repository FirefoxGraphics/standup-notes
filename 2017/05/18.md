nical
* font renderer (almost) done
* looking into having stacktraces when things blow up in wr unit tests



jrmuizel
* Investigated running gecko with WebRenderPaintedLayers turned off
* The result was surprisingly usable
* A lof of Chrome still doesn't show up
* It would be interesting to prototype running webrender without FrameLayerBuilder
* Addition text decoration support and text selection support would improve usability
* Blob image is basically passing tests and I plan to turn it on
* Next steps for blob image involves getting rid of playback during recording (this is blocked on luminance stuff)
