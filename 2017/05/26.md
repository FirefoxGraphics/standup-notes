aosmond
* bug 1365927 (parent protocol for PCompositorBridge) -- discovered some reinit after GPU process crash bugs in my patches, fixed and put up for review
* after tripping the asserts in TextureChild::~TextureChild a lot, started looking into moving shmem allocation into CompositorManager as well
* it trips because the allocating CompositorBridge can get freed before TextureChild, as the shmem moves from content bridges to widget
* to be correct, it should delegate to the parent who gets freed last



mrobinson
* Got WebRender filters in Gecko ready for review: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1365972
* Finished initial implementation of position:sticky in WebRender, but spent a little time investigating how Gecko represents stickiness internally.



kats:
* copied some stuff from PLayerTransaction to PWebRenderBridge, so we can run async-scrolling reftests and not crash APZ in some scenarios. patches on bug 1367837 and bug 1367911
* looking into the reftest failures with APZ on
* also looking into possible OOM/leaking in latest WR update try push



mchang
* finished up OMTP docs

botond:
* Ovidiu found another remaining bug related to incomplete painting of scrollbar thumb after being partially offscreen 
* filed bug 1367488 to track; investigating 
* landed bug 1366365 (missing repaint after async scrollbar drag) 
* thought about writing a mochitest, doesn't really seem doable 
* bug 1352863 (snapping scroll thumb to original position) - addressed review comment and landed 
* mentoring bug 1367062 
* wrote some thoughts on bug 1286068 (Rect representation) 
* looked at the telemetry results for bug 1100357 (async animation of large animated content) 
* posted a summary and re-nominated the bug for QF triage 
* investigated a really weird compiler error (bug 1367798); may be an underlying compiler bug?
