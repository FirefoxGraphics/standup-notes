* pushed apz key scrolling telemetry
* landed a gradient tile position fix
* submitted a fix for an issue with multiple stops at 1.0, or 0.0



nical:
* meeting with Jerry
* good progress on the YUV features in WR, now pending on some Gecko work
* will probably temporarily disable hardware video decoding when WR is enabled so that we can start testing planar ycbcr while waiting for some of the ImageBridge integration to come together
* pinged on some canvas spec question: should we implement a promise version of canvas toBlob? https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2608#issuecomment-298529438
* I like the idea (we should not have a synchronous version of it in the first place)
* Given the way canvas/toBlob it is implemented currently and our available resources I assume it would still be sync in the foreseeable future though
* lots of reviews
