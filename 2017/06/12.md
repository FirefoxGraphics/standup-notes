* image tiling determinism
* LCCR - removing local combined clip rectangle



jrmuizel
* UnscaledFont serialization
* a bit of d3d compiler stuff
* patches up for stripping playback out of recording
* the joy of profiling
* a tiny bit of success with RenderDoc



jnicol
* sharedsurface crash
* laptop setup
* investigated a couple android issues but couldn't reproduce



nical
* rebased euclid patches
* worked on sharing the render backend thread
* looks like we might have some blob image code on the gecko side that is in css pixels instead of device pixels



bas:
* profiling
* regions



aosmond
* bug 1370412 (downscale-on-decode can cause CPU spiking and memory ballooning)
* investigated, there is a problem because downscale-on-decode is all-you-can-eat -- if you always request a new size, you will eventually create a backlog of decodes if the image takes long to decode
* implementing "factor of 2 from native size" sizing when we exceed max number of surfaces and sizes for a given image, will only decode factor of 2 sizes in this state



kats:
* did more apz-keyboard reviews
* looked at another apz reftest, i think WR has issues with clip mask handling so waiting to see what comes out of the issue I filed previously (#1352)
* dealing with euclid changes in the next WR update



mchang
* content / texture client off main thread
* drawtargetcapture



gankro

rhunt
* apz keyboard review feedback



botond
* bug 1371299 (flickering regression from the snapMultiplier work): wrote and landed a fix 
* filed bug 1371771 to give us a way to serialize enums safely without sentinel values 
* bug 1369910 (follow-up simplification in FrameLayerBuilder) 
* debugged the remaining reftest failure, have a new patch on Try 
* started reviewing Ryan's keyboard-apz patches
