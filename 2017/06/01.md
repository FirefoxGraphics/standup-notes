kvark
* WR reviews
* various things: thread profiler, plane-split, etc
* GPUWeb meeting



nical
* got review queue to zero \o/
* bumping euclid in a lot of crates
* moving blob image renderer off the render backend thread



jnicol
* tiled image layers - few issues needing fixed before review



aosmond
* added downscale-on-decode support to imagelib's GetImageContainer, but found more work to be done for various ImageOps wrappers
* reworking existing vector image and downscale-on-decode patches as a result to avoid reviewing throwaway code



Bas
*  I’ve put up my region patch in bug 1369390. It’s a WIP but if Jeff is interested he should feel free to look at it. I’ll probably play with it a little more at least tomorrow and possibly later this week during my PTO. It’s currently slow and not 100% correct. But it will take me a little more investigation to determine if it can potentially be faster than using pixman.



mchang
* luminance reftest failures
* inset box shadow inner clip radius





mrobinson
* Uploading post r+ version of WebRender filters for Gecko
* Looking at remaining filters, should have a patch ready for everything except blur, hue rotate, and opacity.
* Opacity has issues with overlapping content
* Hue rotate looks to have some issues in WebRender



kats:
* landed WR update
* closed graphics branch, use inbound/autoland now
* continued working on APZ stuff, got background-attachment:fixed reftest passing. needs more testing/tweaking. bug 1368496
