aosmond
* bug 1365927 (give PCompositorBridge a parent protocol) -- addressing review comments
* bug 1366097 / 1368776 (improved image containers) -- more investigation / discussion on that marionette headless crash
* gist of it is it happens on startup, appears to layerize an SVG in the chrome, trips an assert where ContainerLayerParameters::mOffset is non-zero which we assert it is zero, but shouldn't happen because the layer is inactive; tnikkel managed to reproduce with a crafted test page, but I have no had luck thus far



lee
* PTO



kats:
* helping Gankro trying to land his border-enabling patches
* more APZ/clipping things. thought i found a bug in the animations API but after building a standalone example app discovered that was not the case

* caused an APZ mochitest to fail; have a workaround up for review 
* requested beta uplift for bug 1365333 (event-regions performance improvement) 
* investigated bug 1368421 a bit further
