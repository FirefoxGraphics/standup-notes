* minting euclid: https://github.com/servo/euclid/pull/205
* WR refining GPU data API: https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/1336
* gpuweb investigation for Vk->D3dD12 resource bindings. Options:
* auto manage descriptor sets, with Gc-like deprecation and renaming (NXT way)
* have a single descriptor heap of each type in the D3D12 backend (simple)
* have descriptor heaps exposed above the descriptor pools (complex)



jrmuizel
* DrawTargetRecording improvements
* getting rid of 



nical
* (will miss the daily)
* some euclid enhancements and cleanups
* got the euclid update to work with WebRender, still bumping other servo crates
* some more experiments with multithreading the blob image stuff



jnicol
* gl shared surface lifetime issues on mac



rhunt
* key-apz
* windows testing
* handling for WidgetKeyboardInput shortcut candidates and other XBL things
* cleanup and some comments
* rebased and started splitting patches



aosmond
* wasted time looking to my debug build locking up; turns out it just can't produce frames fast enough to keep up with vsync, so it constantly requests a new one right away
* worked around with bug 1370209, which adds a new .mozconfig flag --enable-cpp-debug which with --enable-debug-symbols is the same as --enable-debug less --enable-rust-debug
* bug 1366097 (vector images + WR) -- fixed some bugs in this patch set and the related set for multiple image containers for downscale on decode
* now cleaning up to put this back up for review today





alexis
* figuring out gecko opengl compositor/layer design



mchang
* svg reftest failures
* half day PTO



kats:
* got APZ mochitests running with WR. mostly passing, although i observed some weird clipping issues while they were running. need to investigate that
* looking into WR fallback codepaths when the GPU process crashes





mrobinson
* More work splitting up scroll tree
* Helping kats with questions related to WPZ / WR



botond:
* landed bug 1367488 (incomplete painting of scrollbar thumb inside iframe) 
* Markus suggested a follow-up simplification: filed bug 1369910 with a patch 
* reviews: bug 1369298, bug 1369840 
* looked into a scrollbar issue reported in bug 1349750 comment 85 
* looks like a regression from 2014, unrelated to any recent changes (update: found a bug tracking it already) 
* thought more bug 1365761 (scrollbar dragging on Phabricator workboard) 
* suggest going with fix approach #2 (not firing mouse-move events during a scrollbar drag, to match the behaviour of other browsers) 
* while continuing to investigate bug 1368421 (two-finger touchscreen scrolling on a particular page), discovered that APZC tree printing is broken; filed bug 1369929
