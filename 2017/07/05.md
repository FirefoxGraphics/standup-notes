Q: Any requests *for* the Low Level Tools team?  (glandium, froydnj, sewardj, njn, erahm)


jnicol
* trying (unsuccesfully so far) to repro android apz intermittent
* looking in to layerization on a couple websites
* review



kvark
* WR figured out the nested reftest issue, related to the baking space of split planes
* GPUWeb implementing image and sampler creation, descriptor sets updates
* faced an issue with how dset updates are not mapped cleanly on D3D12, got somewhat a solution



jrmuizel
* fixed up my blob deserialization patches (up for review)
* profiling of webrender (we sometimes have big problems with big texture caches)
* will investigate this further
* reviews



nical
* triage
* slow painting on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360306 chromium destroys us on this test case
* webrender actually does pretty well on this page due to small layers and batching.
* is advanced layers batching painted layers? if so we would probably gain a lot from more aggressively layerizing 
* canvas spec change in bug 1360415
* we could ignore it but we'd look different (and in most cases worst) than chrome when downscaling with a certain parameter (maybe kinda niche)
* drawing text in a canvas is slow (d2d and skia alike) (bug 1360222)
* less than a 4th of the time spent in DrawTarget
* drawing characters one by one appears to make things way worse (test case)
* 5 years ago we set the minimum painted layer width to 64 because of a driver bug on b2g. perhap we could change it to 16 or 8? (all of my scrollbars alloc 4 times more pixels than they should).
* cf bug 788411 



aosmond
* reviews
* refactoring work on the pruning old surfaces in the factor of 2 image decoding throttling patches
* half day PTO



kats:
* trying to figure out windows QR reftest failure. can only reproduce when i run the whole folder so it's taking a while
* wrote patches for bug 1378355, landed bug 1373714, bug 1336528, other small stuff



rhunt
* catching up
* investigating smooth scrolling regression from key apz patches



mstange
* parsing cachegrind log, need separate output per process



botond
* bug 1375949 (delay compositor's application of async scrolling by 1 frame) 
* continued investigating test failures (helper_touch_action_regions.html, test_continuous_wheel_events.html, APZ gtests), have fixes for each 
* have one more issue to investigate (scroll-linked effect very occasionally behind 1 frame *ahead*) 
* reviews: bug 1376522 
* continuing to mentor bug 1371846 (adding IPC support for mozilla::Variant) 
* side project: bug 1371771 / bug 1377020 (MOZ_DEFINE_ENUM)
