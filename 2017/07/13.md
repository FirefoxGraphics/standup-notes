* android website performance. there's a weird issue with nested scrollframes making performance seem bad. and then there's lots of actual bad performance from bad layerization. looking to see what framelayerbuilder tweaks could improve it



nical
* WebRenderPaintedLayer invalidation passes the tests, waiting for review
* patch to get canvas.DrawImage to match chromium's behavior when down-scaling (perhaps my first patch in 6 years that (intentionally) changes the behavior of the borwser)
* created a shared folder with papers that might be of interest



kvark
* Metal bindings, fixes, and beta software setup
* WR reviews
* WR Angle issue - https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/1474
* GPUWeb meeting



jrmuizel
* wr/blob image font serialization debugging
* investigated writing a rust hash table gdb pretty printer (found some gdb bugs: https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21763 )



aosmond
* more factor of 2 + image containers rework
* bug 1377869 (another compositor manager reinit crash)
* Windows reuses process IDs and sometimes the GPU process gets restarted with the same PID
* just removing the assert probably isn't enough, as I check the PID elsewhere -- need to sync the state between GPUChild and CompositorManagerChild to avoid races
* made a patch for this, still testing
* bug 1380341 (private browsing assert on sso.mozilla.org)
* turns out sometimes we use the wrong image cache for normal vs private browsing; put a patch up for review



kats:
* started working on layers-free APZ
* put together another WR update to pick up sccache thing that glandium fixed upstream
* picking away at WR mochitests which I'll want to enable when i write more event regions tests



gankro
* rebasing border enabling in gecko
* fixing text-shadow servo pr
* took half day (sick)



mchang
* fixed DrawTargetCapture with rAF reftests
* subpixel AA not being respected on all replays



rhunt
* Investigating uses of key event listeners in chrome
* Looking to update wr bindings with euclid types + cbindgen
* triage
