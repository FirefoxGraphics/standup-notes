* mostly profiling stuff and failing
* tried profiling 2015 nightlies to trace a GIF decoder regression, got most of the way (thanks markus!)  but could not pry data from imagelib threads out of it
* using perf instead, it told me nothing more than what I already knew from inspecting the patches (patch removed a large memcpy, and we got slower somehow...)
* while profiling the current GIF decoder, I found we spend a surprising amount of time in SourceBuffer::Compact (~5% of the image decoder thread time)
* put together a number of patches in bug 1383404 to avoid copying the image source data
* landed bug 1315554 (big ICO support) after updating the gtests
* wrote a patch for related bug 1383579, intermittent assert introduced by the above (harmless on release afaict)
