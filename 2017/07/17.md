* GPUWeb basic implementation of Metal argument buffers as descriptor sets: https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/pull/1370




nical
* landed the wr painted layer invalidation patches
* enable resizing images in webrender
* investigated texture cache size issues with gecko
* need to adapt expiry in function of the size of the cache
* gecko needs to reuse image keys more aggressively
* looked into tiled external images, we already have it
* reviews
* so it looks like there is an issue with ANGLE and a8 textures?
* problematic because PlanarYCbCrImage is very common and it relies on upllading each plane to an a8 texture yuv -> rgb on the cpu would be too big a regression to take.
* looked at a gecko crash, fix on the way

* bug 1380716 (ImageContainer / ImageBridgeChild out-of-sync crash) -- patch landed on central
* bug 1377869 (another CompositorManager reinit crash, GPU PID reused) -- patch landed on central; hopefully we won't see any more related to the CompositorManager on nightly....
* bug 1350408 (SendCreate crash) -- patch up for review
* bug 1381095 (cannot fallback from WR to non-WR after disabling GPU process) -- patch up for review
* bug 1380341 (private browsing trips assert on sso.mozilla.org) -- patch landed on inbound
* now looking at remaining bits to label in imagelib (hoping the biggest piece lands this week...)

* FreeType thread-safety
* still tracking down intermittent shutdown race from Win7 + DWrite



kats:
* continued working on layers-free APZ. landed a quickie patch on bug 1381110 to remove unused code
* helped Gankro a bit with the border layers thing. put patches on bug 1381093 and bug 1381091 to not blame reftests for harness crashes
* reviews etc.



rhunt
* triage
* bizarre test failures on patch for apz key listeners (bug 1379280)
* found a potential shortcut mismatch on OSX with apz.keyboard.enabled
* work on cbindgen + bindings.rs update patch
