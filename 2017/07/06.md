kvark
* WR font snapping
* GPUWeb looking into image to buffer copies, encountered resistance from D3D12
* looking into IntelliJ Idea & GnomeBuilder (again)



jrmuizel
* looked at clipping (can we drop setting up a clip for every item that we push?)
* met with AMD about getting our profiling data into CodeXL
* landed deserialization patches
* text glyph snapping
* 100s of mask layers on github



nical
* looking into making canvas less terrible at drawing text
* lots of stuff can be cached like whether the canvas is a RTL or LTR context and plenty of other stuff
* patch to make the minimum painted layer width 8 instead of 64
* fixing up other patches



aosmond
* bug 1359291 (constantly doing layout with bad image)
* image is fine, but some servers give a malformed HTTP response, so the imgRequest fails; paired with the onerror handler which sets the src again, it causes us to try loading the image from the network again, which eventually could result in getting a proper copy of it (have observed this locally but apparently not for the submitter)
* confirmed Chrome also hammers the server with requests until it gets a proper copy, however they do not do layout again until they get an image, so no flickering
* now working on patch to not do layout again if we are updating a previously broken image, until we have something to display



kats:
* continued digging into windows+WR reftest failure. seems to be related to border-radius in one test affecting another test.
* finished landing gfxMatrix/gfxRect removal
* investigated and fixed bug 1378247, problem with scrollbar dragging on RTL pages
* tried and failed to reproduce bug 1369706, crash with WR (in mesa) found via bughunter



mchang
* fixed DrawTargetCapture::Stroke reftest failures
* looking at some DrawTargetCapture text reftest failures



rhunt
* investigating smooth scrolling regression
* couldn't find a solution quick enough, so I did a partial backout to fix nightly
* encountered a kernel + rr bug
* going to update the version of cbindgen used
* the cli arguments will change, but the bindings should remain the same
