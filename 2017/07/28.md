* reviews and followup with my own patches up for review
* bug 1383579 (regression from big ICO support) -- landed patch
* bug 1382683 (GIF decoder performance regressions)
* ran more tests and confirmed that the changes in bug 1117607 (make image decoders allocate own frame) improve performance (on my machine) despite the telemetry data at the time
* I'm inclined to believe the local test results as they match up with my own analysis of the patch, and subjectively it seems to load the images faster
* now looking into later changes introduced by the various iterations of SurfacePipe
