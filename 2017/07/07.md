* android canvas video drawimage. the code for this was recently removed by snorp's refactoring of SurfaceTexture code. I spoke with him in SF and he doesn't think this can easily be made to work correctly, especially in e10s. I have a few ideas to try.



nical
* investigating invalidation bug with webrender painted layers
* investigating use-after-free crash caused by nested event loops mixed with IPDL protocol lifetimes (yummy!)
* rebased the render backend thread PR



kvark
* trying to get servo working with latest WR
* glyph snapping...
* preparing for the meetup



rhunt
* landed cbindgen update
* investigating what caused the smooth scroll regression
* timing related issue in nsGfxScrollFrame



jrmuizel
* investigating layers-free fallback
* resumed work with fonts in blob images

* bug 1359291 (broken icon flickering)
* got patch working to consistently display broken icon in mochitest, but it never appears to draw the image (although it decodes) when it gets a valid network response; happens without my changes, so looks to be preexisting -- trying to resolve this as well now
* figured out why my simplistic local server test case never worked -- it turns out that the "force load" triggered by setting the img src to the same thing again does not actually force a network request, and the not modified response to the second GET request makes us stop asking; this is probably expected behaviour, so leaving this for now



kats:
* discovered that an earlier reftest is causing bad state in WR and other reftests to fail. digging into it, not sure where the problem is so mostly just reading code
* mrobinson pointed me to his PR with the explicit scroll frame API changes so i pulled those down and got gecko-side patches ready
* landed bug 1378956 to disable WR for transparent windows, which broke due to recent changes



lee
* reviews
* Skia security bug
* fixing Windows 7 + DWrite test failures



mchang
* fixed dangling pointers to source surfaces in DrawTargetCapture



gankro
* working on refactoring all the TextLayer code to match new APIs





botond:
* discussing bug 1377814 (apz-keyboard regression) with Ryan 
* investigating a regression in dragging partially-offscreen scrollbar thumbs 
* looks like a regression from bug 1361970; filed bug 1378455 to track 
* reviews: bug 1378247, bug 1377814 
* looked briefly into bug 1376715 (weird crash in gfxPrefs) 
* bug 1375949 (delay compositor's application of async scrolling by 1 frame) 
* investigated the remaining issue (scroll-linked effect occasionally 1 frame *ahead*), won't block on a fix 
* cleaned up patch series, put the functionality behind a pref, posted for review
