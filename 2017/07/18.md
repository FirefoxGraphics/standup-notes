kvark
* WR reviews
* wrench port to upstream glutin/winit
* looking at WR issues:
* texture cache blowup
* opacity mixing
* talking to Vulkan people



jnicol
* profiling slooow webpage (complex svg) - explore.deloitte.com
* more time spent clearing complex invalid region than actually painting, so looking in to simplifying that region more to see if painting more is actually faster



nical
* fixed image resize PR
* lots of reviews
* would appreciate a second pair of eyes on the canvas layer-free patch
* My patch to disable blob images for widgets seems to have caused timeouts on android, trying to figure out how the hell that might be
* I may have found why we weren't getting good perf out of glClear-ing in WR: fast-clear on intel only works with opaque white or transparent black



rhunt
* triage
* apz key
* posted patch for listeners issues (bug 1379280)
* found a typo causing shortcut comparisons to not work (bug 1381736)

aosmond
* bug 1381095 (make fallback to non-WR work) - updated based on review feedback
* bug 1359833 (imagelib labelling) - updated based on review feedback (one patch left for review!), looking into new try failure caused by this
* also prepared 7 much smaller patches using the framework added in this bug to label all of the remaining imagelib dispatches (will be a followup)
* bug 1350408 (cascaded reinit content crash from WR + GPU crash)  - updated based on review feedback and landed on inbound
