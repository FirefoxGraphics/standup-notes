* spent the day reviewing all the things.



kvark
* VkPortability: call + pipelines state refinement
* Reviews



aosmond
* bug 1405364 (ImageBridgeParent::ShutdownInternal crash)
* figured this out, wrote patch and landed; just a stale process ID that would sometimes create an invalid entry in our map
* bug 1404422 (document stuck loading forever) -- finally greened try, now up for review
* this is a real goldilocks patch, cannot have too much load group blocking, but also cannot have too little load group blocking, all dictated by the multitude of schizophrenic imagelib consumers -- but surprisingly it did not come out too hackish in the end



kats:
* landed more clipping fixes to fix bug 1373802 and bug 1411249. improves the situation for bug 1408792, looking to see if there's a way to fix that completely
* WR update fiddling; sticky API changed so i had to update code on the gecko side



rhunt
* gone on friday
* received graphics corruption regressions from rotatedcontentbuffer refactor patch over weekend
* have fix - looks good on try
