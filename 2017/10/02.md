* reviewed lin's blog post
* prepared wr newsletter #6
* started looking into not using ImageBridge where we should not in wr layers-free
* need to talk about how to do this
* are there any plans already on the side of the people involved with layers-free?
* if not we can plumb something generic that tries to reuse the compositable infrastructure or do something specific
* what's the image story (I don't remember very well what Andrew did in this area)?
* at some point we'll need to talk about webgl too (right now it's hacked into doing the slow path (readback into shm)
* looked at why borders look bad in wr a bit
* sorry, mic still busted :(
* i think that the issue might be fixed
