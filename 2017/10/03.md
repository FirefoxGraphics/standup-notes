jnicol
* surfacetexture mutex. have it working but apparently surfacetextures can only be used from one process anyway so won't work with e10s



kvark
* https://github.com/kvark/ipc-future
* WR crash in text shadows: https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/1790 , refactored a bunch of prepare-for-render code



nical
* fixed a bug in the border shader and improved the quality of the anti aliasing
* looking at the wr frame coherency issues
* will wait for the layers-full removal, though



lee
* thread-safe weak pointer



aosmond
* bug 1331944 (shared surfaces + imagelib + WR) -- base implementation seems to be working, working out some kinks, in particular the combo of load tab, open new tab to about:memory and minimize, and go back to tab (boom crash as there were lingering references on the render thread); need to do something similar to the async image manager



jrmuizel
* wrote a patch to preallocate the webrender display list buffer
* further webrender display list building performance investigation
* talked with dtolnay about how to make our serde serialization go faster. He suggested a reasonable plan



gankro
* optimizing text for jeff
* investigating stylo hashmap crasher



kats:
* wrote and landed patches for bug 1403176 to stop repainting on mousemove. ran into some rr problems while debugging, filed rr bugs
* a couple of time-consuming reviews (had to apply patches and test)



rhunt
* debugging reftests for copy front to back with OMTP (bug 1399692)
* solved some, still have some more
