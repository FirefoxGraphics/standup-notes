aosmond
* bug 1404422 (document load never finishes) -- now fixed all but one test case, one part of a print preview test fails on Windows non-e10s; still piecing this one together but it either looks like a timer fired that shouldn't have, or we are redrawing the preview window unexpectedly



kats:
* landed another WR update
* put up patches for bug 1410777
* looking into more clipping bugs (bbc page, bug 1408792)
