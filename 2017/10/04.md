kvark
* WR reviews, image tiling artifacts
* VkPortability - working on better CI
* GPUWeb prototype: debug logging, OSX debugging



nical:
        taking the day off



jrmuizel
* display list creation
* wrote an unsafe serializer that's faster
* look at getting rid of some copies that we still have
* found an issue where we churn in ScrollingLayersHelper on Gmail
* kats is looking into it
* with serialization patches from above this has taken over from text as the slowest part
* bought a computer for a throbber perf regression that we can't reproduce





Sotaro

kats:
* landed patches to delete layers-full code. involved a bunch of rebasing
* investigated an intermittent failure, marked it skip-if webrender. marked another test random-if
