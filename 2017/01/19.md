kvark
* more discussion of the quantum scrolling in WR:
* figured the internal representation and algorithms
* still not clear what API should be like
* discussing the need for multiple graphics API backends
* got Angle working with a few caveats, started filing issues and submitting patches
* looking into WebGL flipped texture issue



rhunt
* worked to land a mix blend mode pr in WR
* investigated one last mix blend mode reftest failure
* investigated wr texture filter reftest failure



lee
* landed WR radial gradients
* experimenting with improving gradient lookups in WR



aosmond
* refactored shared memory patch based on discussions from yesterday
* will now attempt to realloc a new buffer and handle instead of copying when a new WR process wants access to the buffer
* constrained to only release the handle after it has been shared *and* imagelib has finished writing to the buffer (avoids decoder still writing when we copy)
* added memory protections to mark shared memory as read only after decoder finished and for mapped entries on WR side
* looking into how to fix case where we have multiple WebRenderBridgeChild objects pointing to the same WR process



kats:
* discussions on stuff (scrolling architecture in webrender, plumbing discussion)
* some housekeeping with old reviews, sending out emails, dealing with needinfos, etc.
* looking into talos regressions caused by my TabParent/TabChild change



mchang
* landed black on white cg fonts
* plumb text color through fonts for gamma correction
* port of skia's gamma correction



mstange
* landed bug 1331402, should reduce battery usage of plugins in background tabs
* some reviews
* discussed webrender scroll architecture
* looked at the DisplayItemData crash with Bas, still no idea what's going on



jnicol
* looking at android oom crash
* uplifted gtk3 glitch to aurora
