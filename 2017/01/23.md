martin:
I'm working on adding the concept of reference
frames to WebRender. I have a PR which does that and also fixes some
longstanding issues with fixed position elements. In order for that to
land, I also created a precursor patch which does a bunch of cleanup
[1]. I can have the other PR ready when that lands.
