* After a few days of wrestling with spark/telemetry, I now have GPU process histogram data, notably GPU process initialisation time.
* Going to follow up with the telemetry team as I had to modify their code to get it to work for grabbing GPU process histograms
* If anyone else is interested in this data ping me.
