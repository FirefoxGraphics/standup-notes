Nical's Taipei meeting:
Here are my notes from the quantum video meeting, in which we don't talk about video anymore these days:


We talked about the compositor/render thread split and how to split compositables, textures and the compositor to separate what need to happen on the compositor thread from what needs to happen on the renderer thread. (compositor thread meaning "ipc receiver thread" in the discussions we had in Hawa√Ø).
We'll probably split the compositor API in two, the WebRenderCompositor would only implement the compositor-thread specific things, the gpu-facing bits would move to the renderer abstraction and the non-webrender compositors would implement both (in order to stay compatible with TextureHost/Source). TextureHost would then depend on the Compositor while TextureSource would depend on the Renderer.


Current status:


Jerry
* Working on the WebRender update issues (gl context creation failure on try).
* External image work is blocked on that.
* Nical
* Working on the render thread
   * Landing some code in the branch, the code is not actually used yet, it's just there so that people can look at it, review it and maybe help out.
   * Render thread creation works
   * creating a renderer on the render thread works 
   * shutting down a renderer requires a patch in webrender, so it's blocked on the wr update.
   * can't draw yet.
   * it does not use the compositor api (at least not yet)
   * Sotaro
* Working on making the gl bindings dynamic in WebRender
* 


Blockers:
The WebRender update is blocking:
* External image
* Enabling the render thread (although there is a lot to do before being unable to make progress)

The render thread work is blocking:
* figuring out the last details of how to do texture sharing.



Next steps:


Nical
* Continue working on the render thread.
* Will be in Toronto next week and the week after.
* Sotaro
* Continue working on gl bindings.

Jerry
* Continue working on the WebRender update.
* Will go through the compositor API and figure out what belongs to the compositor thread and what needs to be moved to the render thread.



Open questions:
* Can we get away with only supporting tiled painted layers (no .rotated buffer)?
   * Means we don't use D2D for (scrollable) SVG
* Can we get away with not implementing the masking functionality that is currently baked in the compositable code (have masks created in frame layer builder and passed to WebRender without any specific code in ImageHost/TiledContentHost)?
