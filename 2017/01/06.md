nical:
* progress on the render thread (should I land unused code? <-- yes)



kvark:
* WR wrench/yaml/image mask investigation & support
* Continued looking into WebGL TexImage tests failing with LUMINANCE_ALPHA. Finally found 2.5 more bugs in the implementation (aside from the UB-fixing patch yesterday), still haven't got proper solutions to them though.



ashughes:
* reproduced and bisected bug 1325810 for Kip, will resume testing further bisections on Friday
* continued evaluation of GPU Process Telemetry experiment
* met with cpeterson to work out some test planning details for Quantum Renderer



gw280
* Working out how rust/webrender integrates with Gecko to look at getting it to build/work on Android
* Going to look at canvas fallback potentially not working today
* Feeling human again, yay!



aosmond
* finished / worked out kinks in patch to move imagelib to use source surfaces instead of volatile buffers directly, next up is creating shared and buffered data surfaces
* looked into ico decoder impl on behalf of favicon service dev questions



jnicol
* gtk3 rendering glitch 1319764



kats:
* put up patch on bug 1328066 for review, to fix the perma-checkerboarding issue
* investigated and put up a patch on bug 1328129 as well, although it probably won't do much
* looking into the google sheet scrollbar dragging not working properly
* still unable to get the test for touch-dragging working consistently in automation



rhunt
* looked into mix-blend-mode qr reftests
* should be just plumbing gfx::CompositionOp to WR::MixBlendMode
* a potential clipping or rendering issue occurs when that is done



lee
* learning about webrender



mchang
* text display item, plumbing mostly done, font looks off



botond:
* landed bug 1326290 (regression from async scrollbar dragging) 
* clarified a C++ issue related to references and temporaries (tl;dr: the pattern is safe according to the standard, but gcc < 7 has a bug that makes it unsafe) 
* bug 1286068 
* tried to figure out what change fixed the first issue, but I couldn't repro it going as far back as 2015-01 
* discussion about the other issue; summarize in bug with an outline of some possible approaches 
* some interview prep for Friday 
* going through some of the APZ bugs that arni filed



jrmuizel
* upstreaming wrench iframe changes
* looked at masked layers with kvark
