* looked at bug 1352915 (transform-style:preserve-3d and background-attachment:fixed); spec is unclear, filed https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1199
* mentored bug 1180799: reviewed final patch and landed (but then it got backed out because it regressed Android)
* reviews: bug 1354924, parts of rbarker's dynamic toolbar patch series



kvark: (copied from 14th)
* a bit of reviews, looking into the border test failures
* reviewing Googles proposal draft
* plane split integration, messing with euclid



kats:
* finished first review pass of rbarker's dynamic toolbar patches
* more fiddling with WR clip API and how we use it on the gecko side (bug 1357065). found an assertion error in WR (filed #1122)
* came up with a rough plan for where to start with APZ on webrender, will start hacking stuff up for that
* wrote patches to not expose window.TouchEvent and friends if APZ is disabled, since we don't actually support touch (bug 1356695)
* periodically doing try windows WR-enabled pushes, diagnosing failures



mchang

* bug 1331944 (shared memory for images + WR) -- updated based on review feedback, just verifying this now
* bug 1356190 (allow opening existing shared memory as read only) -- updated based on review feedback, waiting on try results



mrobinson
* Implementing HeapSizeOf for ClipId, so that we can use it directly in Servo
* More work moving Servo-specific code out of WebRender
* Need to get Servo to use ClipId directly
* Have Servo handle creating and assigning references frames (Gecko already does this)
