aosmond
* bug 1383682 (high volume intermittent image failure) -- investigating, seems to be related to not always using sync decoding (that would explain a lot of intermittents potentially)

nical
* addressed review comments on the patch that fixes off main thread usage of some IPDL actors
* started reviewing Ryan's patches about tiled OMTP
* work on webrender ipc resource transfer
* first attempt was to pass ByteBuf instead of shmem ranges in resource updates structs (can't do because IPDL)
* second attempt was to pass separate array of resource updates and array of ByteBuf (can't do because IPDL)
* third attempt (WIP): implement a data pipe on top of a shmem.
