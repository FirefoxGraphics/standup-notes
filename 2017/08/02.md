Bas:
* Hash table related; Naveed will test
* Gmail DL performance - initial DL performance is now PF:Q1?



Daosheng
* work on PBO compress texture failures

Michael
* Check WebGL context initialization time
* Upgrade ANGEL to latest version and address conformance failures on try

Ethan
* convert missing display item which generated container layer, like filter, mask, nsDisplayColor

Morris
* got r+ to support canvas with layers-free
* fix css animation with layers-free
* convert missing display item which generated container layer

Jerry
* work on big image support for WebRender
* Need review for nv12 texture support (bug 1357299)



jnicol
* started work on using SurfaceTextures for tiles on android
* have things drawn on screen \o/ (but the wrong things in the wrong places for now)



nical
* sorted out layer manager UAF bug on beta/esr
* removed the job scheduler
* got the webrender transaction PR in a landable state
* looking at external image tiling



Sotaro
* Fixed transaction id handling of WebRenderBridgeParent
* Fixed ImageCompositeNotification when WebRender is enabled 
* Fixed crash that is caused by webrender initialization failure
* Disabled render_on_scroll in webrender
* Added log of EndTransaction to on screen latency for WebRender



mchang
* async omtp draw + record at the same time
* async omtp deadlock



aosmond
* animated image improvements
* got prototype working for decoding animated frames on-demand and only once we hit a certain memory threshold, releasing old frames as it goes along
* compared CPU usage between Linux optimized build and Chromium; similar content process overhead to drive large animation (although basic compositing hurts us -- forcing OpenGL compositing brings us on par overall)
* memory usage is obviously down dramatically for larger animations
* still has a number of bugs / hacks to fix, this is my focus now



kats:
* large flurry of small reviews
* more of the same as yesterday (multi-doc API changes, APZ layers-free work, intermittent failure investigation)



jrmuizel
* blob invalidation
* have merging written
* most of the pieces are in place (need to start testing)



gankro
* following up on fallible allocation
* got roped into some dropck/unsafe code stuff





rhunt
* skype isn't working
* apz key passive + mousemove listeners



botond
* pref apz.autoscroll.enabled
* talked to :CJKu about bug 1382534 (transition effect on BBC website) 
* started working on a fix based on this discussion; not working out so far 
* had discussion with Markus, have a revised plan 
* landed bug 1105109 (APZ autoscrolling) behind a pref 
* landed a patch to fix a new warning with gcc 7 (bug 1383919) 
* bug 1385468 (notify browser.xml when APZ cancels an autoscroll) - have a patch up for review 
* blog post about C++ committee meeting now live: https://botondballo.wordpress.com/2017/08/02/trip-report-c-standards-meeting-in-toronto-july-2017/
