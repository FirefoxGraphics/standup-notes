nical
* talked with jerry about external image + tiling and wr video stuff
* updated max texture size assertion to verify that the tilitng issue is that we are creating big masks in gecko
* more figuring out what happened with PTO, apparently I lost 10 days
* trying to figure out how removing the gfx job scheduler break





gankro
* updated tons of outdated documentation in the rustonomicon
* reviewing n o n  l e x i c a l lifetimes RFC (I'll be on the hook for documenting some of its implications)
* rebasing some patches for text (maybe ready to go again?)



aosmond
* animated image improvements
* reworked frame buffer changes to AnimatedSurfaceProvider into separate class, fixed bugs, writing gtests to cover all state transitions/races between display and decoding threads
* bug 1380649 - gmail icons disappear on Mac after suspend/resume
* since the image remains in the cache, but is now just 100% transparent, it suggests our volatile buffers got purged instead of restored; put together a speculative patch to make some questionable behaviour of volatile buffers more consistent, might be related
