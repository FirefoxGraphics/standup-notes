* started looking at webgl mochitests with QR, looks like we're OOMing (had to talk to #taskcluster to get that far)
* discussion about telemetry for frame throughput, wrote a quick WIP for bug 1339220
* looking at the taskcluster-github integration to see if we can run webrender CI on taskcluster in addition to/instead of travis
* rebased the webrender update to graphics tip
* there's a couple of crashes that appear to be regressions from the graphics merge, so i'll look into those
