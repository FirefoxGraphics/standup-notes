* trying out RenderDoc 0.32 on Linux, it's not ready yet, for Intel at least



nical
* vector image stuff
* looking into tiling in webrender (for large images and large vector images)
* would be great if we could lazily allocate tiles
* that requires some sort of knowledge of what part of the big image is displayed each frame



aosmond
* bug 1290293 - amended patch to reduce memsets in SurfacePipe when the allocated buffer is not on the heap (e.g. shared memory for WR, volatile memory on Windows/Mac)
* triage



lee

kats:
* finished merging graphics to m-c, bug 1335455. no history stripping done, so business as usual for work on the graphics branch
* tracked down the problem in mochitest-jetpack when running with QR. looks like there's a problem in jetpack which nobody is going to fix anytime soon (details in bug 1335906) so I'll just look at other mochitest suites.
* triaging new bugs, responding to email threads
* wrote a script to slap latest webrender into graphics branch and push to try, will cron it to try and reduce webrender-update burden



rhunt
* wr pr for using glblend instead of readback for some mix-blend-modes
* wr pr for isolating stacking contexts with mix-blend-mode
