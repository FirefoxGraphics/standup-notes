nical
* reviews
* tiled image PR up,
* working on followup to the tile stuff (supporting stetching and repeating in the easy cases)



jnicol
* wrote webrender (and wrench) patch to use premultiplied alpha textures
* works on gecko. need to test servo before landing
* investigating border layer looking wrong for browser back button



lee
* pixman crash patches
* webrender text layer stuff





jrmuizel
* helped get the layer transform patch landed
* wrote some premultiply/unpremultiply code for wrench and servo
* looked a bit why debugging opt rust builds sucks so much. Made a bit of progress here.



mchang
* fixed spread/offset cases in WR box shadow
* inset and border radii broken in WR



aosmond
* bug 1337111 (animation refactoring)
* improved the blend animation filter to use faster skia methods to perform blending (thanks lee!)
* fixed problems when used with deinterlacing/ADAM7 filters, and realized how inefficient the pipeline is when they are in use (memset, memset, and memset some more just to be safe)
* discovered miscalculation with dirty rects, haven't found root cause yet
* bug 1290293 (reduce memsets)
* there will be a new part / bug required before this can land
* changing DataSourceSurface::MappedSurface to include a valid rect which tells the caller which rows, making DataSourceSurface::GetData/Stride protected so that all callers must go through maps



rhunt
* investigate converting nsDisplayBackgroundImage to WR
* Added webrender bindings for radial, linear gradients



botond:
* meeting with QA to discuss testing of async scrollbar drag
* would like to try and have the feature ride the trains in 55
* reviews: bug 1339831, bug 1339220 
* wrote patches for bug 1328065 (parent process scrolling issue; also affect subframes in content process in some configurations), and came up with a test plan
