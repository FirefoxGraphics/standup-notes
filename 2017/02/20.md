* added image tiling to wrench
* added a way to generate images in wrench
* for example try replacing the image path with "xygradient(500, 500)" or "solidcolor(128,128,128,255, 1000, 800)"
* writing some image reftests
* looks like we do some kind of snapping which messes up the reftest when tiling
