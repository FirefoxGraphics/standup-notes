kats:
* trying to figure out why buildbot won't build firefox with webrender. got a loaner to debug it
* landed a WR update and enabled mochitest-gl tests (graphics and eventually m-c). next is media mochitests, which also appear to be OOMing
* something landed in WR last night that causes reftest failures. bisecting that now. it might just need some binding changes
* landed some things - 1343089, 1339220, 1341691
