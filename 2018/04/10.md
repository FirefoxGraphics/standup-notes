* Bug 1440690 follow-up: animation timing was broken due to mAnimationReadyTime not being set in WebRenderLayerManager::EndEmptyTransaction()



jnicol
* chased this 3d transform issue deep down in to skia path drawing code.
* * kvark
* WR borders opt landing, flickering, external texture loading



nical
* still doing some primitive repetition work
* getting some artifacts due to mod(clamp(a, b), b) != clamp(a, b)



gankro
* some analysis of bugs
* mostly fell asleep for 6 hours for some reason (PTO)



jrmuizel
* made a fix for rawtest non-determinism
* made a fix for blob dirty rect stuff
* and then my day turned bad
* I broke Mac CI
* This is still a mystery https://github.com/servo/webrender/issues/2638
* My git repo broke



rhunt
* fixed patch for limiting painting to visible region when creating a tile
* with that talos is only improvements now
* there is just a AWSY regression, but it seems that is tiling overhead which i'm okay with, it's only in the tab open part of the test
* improvements
* 11.6% tps
* 8.3% tsvgr
* 12.82% tsvgx
* 58% rasterflood_gradient
* 22% rasterflood_svg
* maybe 2-3% tp6
* working on getting patches ready to land



kats:
* addressing review comments on the async-scene building patchset
* triaging windows-qr reftest failures. most seem to be fuzzable, only a few are legit failures
