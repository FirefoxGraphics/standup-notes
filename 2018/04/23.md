* bug 1453801 (AWSY / memory leak with WebRender) -- got reviewed and landed, will have "regression" on awsy image memory due to misreporting from before

kats:
* prepared WR update
* fixing some async-scene building fallout and follow-ups. discovered that all transactions are going through the scene builder thread, so it's really not that async, but should be easy to fix
* reviewing hiro's patches for animation stuff
* made layer transaction ids a struct instead of uint64_t
