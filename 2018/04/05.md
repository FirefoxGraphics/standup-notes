jnicol (gone to view a house, we didnt get the last one :( but this one's on the same street!)
* think i've figured out the 3d transform issue
* we don't currently take 3d transforms in to account when deciding whether to prerender transformed content
* so we attempt to prerender the entire thing, but it's way too big. why are all my bugs always layers that are too big!?



nical
* PR to support sampling from the render task cache in brush image primitives
* needed to prerender repeted patterns.



kvark
* WR edge lines in ps_image, RenderDoc
* VkPortability image-format-queries, CTS
* WebGPU call



rhunt
* landed a papered over fix for crash in GenerateFallbackData
* put a patch up so symbolstore.py will fail if dumpsyms.exe fails
* looked at a profile with heavy directx contention and learned some about dx threading
* learned about vsync some more



kats:
* continued on APZ threading changes. should have next set of patches up today
* landed WR update
* duped a big pile of intermittent failure bugs into the fix that ryan landed yesterday



miko
* Fixed remaining problems Matt pointed out with opacity flattening, hopefully landing tomorrow after Matt finishes reviews
* Meanwhile working on 1440690



gankro
* investigating talos issues 
* a LOT seem to be shader compilation, should be fixed by sotaro's work
* running into talos tests crashing with webrender+profiling
* started work on new HashMap/BTreeMap API for perf/control



jrmuizel
* wrote and landed the nth rewrite of the blob merging code along with a new test that catches the previous problem
* word of warning: retained display lists are not retained with overlay scroll bars
* looked at tsvg regression
* turns out the blob renderer is repainting the entire blob every update (shouldn't be too hard to fix)
