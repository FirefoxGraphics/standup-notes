* Spent the day trying to reproduce bug 1452800



jnicol
* looked in to opacity issue on whatsapp
* profiling layer building optimisation



nical
* figured out the regression on the repetition PR, rebased, more fixes
* PR to pre render gradients for repetitions



aosmond
* AWSY regression investigation
* found some cases where we keep the images alive longer than expected (although that should be unrelated to my change) with WebRenderImageData
* ongoing otherwise
* animated image high CPU regressions
* put together a relatively small patch which lets us avoid advancing animated images only if something is using the results (drawing, has an image container)
* discussions with tnikkel about this; going to work further on this for nightly, but I think at this point it is best to disable the discarding of frames for large GIFs for beta



jrmuizel
* Blob image invalidation assertion removal
* mstange and I made a crash test that shows the issue



rhunt
* investigating improvements to our windows vsync code
* jrmuizel suggested using WaitForVBlank when we're not using DirectX in that process
* chrome uses software timers on Windows < 8.1
* on Windows > 8.1 they use a driver function which I think WaitForVBlank uses
* trying to understand our vblank time calculation code, prototyping a test app
* landed improvements to tiling and pref for enabling parallel skia for windows



gankro
* adding back subpixel-in-masks optimizations, mostly went down a false path (I think)
* trying to enable partial ligatures, looking into single regression



botond
* discussed APZ intern project ideas with kats 
* reviews: bug 1453469 (mentored), bug 1453463, bug 1451469 
* investigation of SetConfirmedTargetAPZC crash in bug 1443424 (seems to require overlay scrollbars + WR to repro) 
* found reliable STR for it



kats:
* addressed review comments for the sampler thread changes. need to fix some scrollbar data propagation before i can land it, working on that now
* landed WR update
* landed fix for bug 1454430 which was a regression from previous changes



kvark
* WR reviews, init_transform_fs
* WebGPU prototype building
