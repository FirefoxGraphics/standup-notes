* layer building optimisation (1449608)
* webgl crash (1443149)



kvark
* WR reviews and triage, briefly looked at the performance issue with scroll node clips
* WebGPU prototype bits



nical
* new wr newsletter out
* patch to bake tile spacing using a render task (it looks like it works but I am not 100% it does)
* the PR adding support for repetitions in the shader doesn't pass reftests after rebase, investigating



aosmond
* woke to sadness
* bug 1444537 (animated image 100% CPU / shutdown hangs) -- landed but backed out due to intermittent mochitest assert failure
* bug 1454149 (animated image high CPU)
* turns out unrelated to bug 1444537 and there are pages with a dozen very large animated GIFs, so there is much decoding churn
* even if no GIFs are in view, we still decode them; Chrome does not (it stops the animation and resumes once it comes back into view)
* this combined with struggles in the other bug may cause me to effectively pref off this animated image optimization for beta to buy time
* bug 1453801 (remove unused consumer tracking of shared surfaces) -- wrote and landed (see below)
* bug 1454114/1454112 (AWSY regressions) -- caused by bug 1453801 which should have reduced the footprint not increased (sigh)
* bug 1445479 (imgCacheValidator::RemoveProxy crash) -- updated patch again based on review feedback, hopefully we got the behaviour right this time



rhunt
* made it back to minnesota somehow, it's been a whiteout since then until this morning
* talking about future work with people, and doing some planning



kats:
* was PTO friday afternoon
* wrote a small patch to prevent dispatch-to-content regions getting too complex
* continued async-scene building work, trying to get stuff green on try



miko
* Tons of small fixes and reviews



botond
* reviews: bug 1434710 (mentored), bug 1451469 (partial) 
* more work on simulations to compare Firefox and Chrome fling physics models on Android; concluded investigation 
* next step is to implement Chrome's model in our code; bug 1448439 tracks
