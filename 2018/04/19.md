* bug 1453801 / AWSY regression
* fixed more (!) existing bugs in the patch, finally saw the (modest) resident memory improvement I was expecting in the first place
* there is a regression on the image memory, but I have now concluded that is due to mis/underreporting of the true footprint
* we are more in line with linux64 results as I would expect

kats:
* patches on bug 1455302 and bug 1454594, small things related to the async-scene-building feature. that can be enabled in nightly now. i'll test it more and then add it to gfx.webrender.all
* some other miscellaneous fixes: bug 1453863, bug 1454465, bug 1454974
* disabled the test-verify jobs on QR since they seem to be trying to verify even tests that we don't care about (e.g. browser-chrome)
