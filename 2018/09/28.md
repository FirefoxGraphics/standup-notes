  * async animated images more or less ready for review, save changes I may make to better support recycling
  * got a hack of frame recycling working with WR + async animated images
    * CPU usage is finally approaching that of plain firefox -- not quite as low, but nearly (maybe pgo will help)

  * fixed another case of large rendertask crashing firefox
  * ui feezes stuff looked at the most common causes of sync flush, some of them should be easy to avoid some less so.
  * looked at a gpuview trace of the multiple window + download animation problem
    * I think that the at least in part the problem is that we run out of GPU memory and from there things go nuts
    * Not sure how the download animation triggers this and not a CSS animation but I think that further reducing GPU memory usage is our most actionable way to make progress here

  * polished relative scroll offset patches
    * put them up for review
    * realized i forgot to do try run
    * going through test failures..
  * looked at security bug with WinCompositorWidget
    * AddressSanitizer is very helpful
    * put up patch to fix the problem

kats:
  * re-enabled a test that's now passing (dash-1.html) as well as removed fuzzy-if annotations from other tests (bug 1439571)
  * trying to get generic-worker set up for the mac CI, this time with proper production stuff instead of everything being specific to me
  * looked at the parallax bug, didn't make much progress but have a plan of attack

  * reviews: bug 1451439, bug 1420996, bug 1259450, bug 1493790
  * filed bug 1494422 for extend-to-zoom (new viewport compat issue)
  * bug 1486695 (Android scrolling correctness bug): reworked approach to fix reftest failure
    * new approach does not fix bug 1339925 unfortunately; that looks like a more general container scrolling issue
  * bug 1470504 (enabling zoom tests on desktop): some more progress
