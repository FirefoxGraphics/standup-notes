* adjusting to 30 degree temperature drop
* catching up on emails, needinfos, etc
* framelayerbuilder reviews

* looking at WR captures for gradient breakage (https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/2441)
* fixing WR YUV rectangles - https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/2452
* improved WR capturing a bit - https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/2451
* GPUWeb call + feedback processing

nical
* rebased, addressed reviews and landed the async scene PR (off by default)

aosmond
* bug 1427639 (images exhaust file handles on Android)
* wrote and put up patches for review to fix this; they fix the problem the user faced, but now seem to cause OOM-related failures for Android reftests
* putting together an additional patch + tests which attempts to evict image surface cache entries if the decoder allocations fail
* this may be related to the confusing animated image mochitest intermittent failures; if we can't allocate frames beyond the first, it still successfully decodes

kats:
* forked proc-macro2, quote, syn, and made a version of cbindgen that can run standalone
* continued investigation of windows reftest failures. the font data being passed to WR is different in the case where it fails, but seems valid still. so the problem is likely on the WR side
* WR update patching and stuff

miko
* Continued improving opacity flattening

jrmuizel
* investigated the performance problem from yesterday: it exposed a bunch of problems
* fallback for svg background images
* this uses create similar surface which interacts badly with tiling
* it shouldn't be creating a similar surface
* we have too many clips
* we should probably try to not use antialiased clips in Skia all the time
* we need to make sure we tile blob images more
