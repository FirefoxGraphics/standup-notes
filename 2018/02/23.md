* bug 1427639 (images exhaust file handles on Android) -- fixed reftest failures, and landed
* bug 1435291 (background SVGs use fallback)
* looked at this again, no idea what I was doing with original patch, but this is caused by the image container impl for SVGs
* not just background images, border images affected as well
* getting reftests passing now

kats:
* more time spent on the windows reftest issues. understand the flow better now, and don't see any obvious problems with the glyph rasterization or texture cache bits. data seems to be flowing to the right places at the right times, so now i need to dump the data to make sure it's good. if it is then i'll need to renderdoc or something to dive deeper on the gpu side
* landed WR update
* fixed some searchfox bugs
* wrote a PR to unfork quote since we have a path forward now - https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/pull/62
