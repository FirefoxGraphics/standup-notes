* DrawCommand logging was backed out due to a bindgen failure
* Debugged the cause and got a workaround
* Wrote a patch to add caching back with POMTP to FilterNodeSoftware for bug 1436723
* Did a bunch of test runs of MotionMark with OMTP, POMTP and different tile sizes

kats:
* spent a chunk of time trying to figure out how to get cbindgen unbusted so the binary can run without cargo. got close, but needs a rustc patch
* debugging/bisecting the WR update failures - linux and windows reftest
* rebasing my clipping rewrite

gankro
* progress on shadow clipping
* looking into intermittents

jrmuizel
* blob image invalidation
* fixed blending and clipping handling
* most reftest failures look to be scale related
* I began working on proper scale handling
* looked at the inactive transform display list mutate test with webrender
* with Miko's patch and Kat's scroll layer info patch we go from 3fps to 22fps which is better than trunk
* we're now slowed down by the webrender side https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437091
