* bug 1437886 (WR disabled but shared surfaces in use => crash) -- updated patch to fix broken tests, relanded
* bug 1436247 (image decoding threadpool improvements) -- found it was one optional part which broke the tests, relanded the other parts, hopefully they stick, will land the remaining at a later date
* bug 1438207 (ICO + WR => file handle left open) -- landed
* bug 1427639 (images exhaust file handles on Android) -- volatile memory on Android needs us to keep a file handle around, still thinking on best way to solve besides avoiding volatile memory for smaller images
* bug 1416328 (implement img decoding attribute) -- very useful for failing mochitests expecting sync decode, started work on this

lee (read-only, car issues)
* still stuck in Skia Mac debugging hell

kats:
* reproduced the windows reftest failure, got a capture. kvark investigated it, looks like a gecko side issue (and also a capture portability problem on mac). will continue investigating
* thought about the async scene building, made some conclusions about how we would need to approach it. needs more thinking still, but i'll write it up and put it in a bug
* getting the next WR update patches ready
