* bug 1436247 (imagelib threadpool improvements) -- wasted some time looking into a bug that did not exist -- turns out, I misconfigured my nightly profile purposefully and forgot...
* bug 1439285 (stylo-chrome + theme => image flickering) -- investigating, for some bizarre reason it appeared with bug 1383682 landing which should have *reduced* flickering; it seems to be really grounded in the fact that moz-extension URLs do not support caching, so when we validate, we always discard the result
* bug 1416328 (img decoding attribute support) -- got this working, need to clean up and look into testing needs (WPT probably exist somewhere?)
