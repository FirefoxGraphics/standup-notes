  * WebGPU push constants benchmark
  * Szeged Vulkan&DX12 builds
  * catching up

nical
  * making the tile decomposition algorithm support arbitrary origins and boundary tiles on all sides

rhunt
  * getting back into action

jbonisteel

  * Reminder again: H2 goal closeout: please write up your "greatest hits" for H2 ideally before Dec 21!
    * David and Maire will largely be handling this round for GFX but I am helping collect info from the team
    * You should be able to add these directly to Workday, if you have issues - let me know
  * Q1 OKR conversations with Andeas
    * Want to make sure we have more than just WR represented

aosmond
  * bug 1501195 - distilled a reduced test case from the page, turned into reftest
    * probably related to bug 1453747 although there is a bit more going on as an empty transform "translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px)" results in a new stacking context

jnicol
  * investigating bug 1496540 (webrender border feftest failure)

kats:
  * figured out a solution to the pathfinder build, starting to land patches and propagating version bumps to get windows CI up
    * https://github.com/servo/libfreetype2/pull/28
    * https://github.com/servo/webrender/pull/3400
  * looked into the minimized window problem (bug 1491512), sotaro pointed out what the problem was and i'm trying to come up with a good fix.
  * also found another possible leak on windows, will investigate that more
  * patches up on bug 1499655 for intermittent failure

lee
  * wrote up some debugging code to try and gain more information on WR missing font crashes
  * investigating why large glyphs are not rendering in WR

botond
  * reviews: bug 1513015, JanH's patch series for bug 1478776 (event handlers for Visual Viewport API)
  * triage various APZ bugs, update expired telemetry
  * looking into bug 1511915 (tier 2 permafail caused by bug 1509552), no luck in running the test locally so far
  * continued work on containerless zooming

jrmuizel
  * blob recoordination mostly works now (test failure investigation)
  * triage
