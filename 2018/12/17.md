  * dug myself out of bugmail backlog
    * quickie patch for an APZ crasher in bug 1511701
    * some investigation and proposed solution for bug 1511025 (searchfox network error due to giant symbol list)
    * assigned myself WR bugs 1513133 and bug 1496194 (fuzzing crashes)
  * landed fixes for bug 1491512 (window minimization leak) and servo/webrender#3416 (frame building leak)
  * made a reduced testcase for bug 1495962 (sticky positioning error), digging into that
  * discovered intermittent pathfinder build failures in my windows CI stuff which is quite puzzling because everything relevant should be pretty deterministic
  * WR update-a-palooza

  * bug 1510139 (SVG flickering / not showing) -- got mostly to the bottom of this
    * there are two different scenarios where invalidations don't get passed to the vector image to re-rasterize
    * fixing those solves both the flickering and the images not showing up
    * still need to understand why we don't get an invalidation in one scenario (I think, but need to prove, it should be broken on non-WR)

rhunt
  * scroll anchoring reviews

botond
  * reviews: bug 1511701
  * bug 1511915 (tier 2 permafail caused by bug 1509552): repro'd in emulator, investigated; it's just a snafu with test expectations
  * containerless scrolling (bug 1459312): made progress on fixed-pos rendering; there's still a clipping issue to fix
