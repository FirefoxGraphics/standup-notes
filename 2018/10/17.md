rhunt
  * did some skia security reviews
  * did some cbindgen reviews for emilio and company
  * looked briefly at gpu process behavior in AWSY
  * wrote up notes on requirements for all uses of drawWindow I'm aware of
    * there is a lot of reinventing the wheel for taking screenshots
    * I think we can expose one or two APIs that should be sufficient for everycase
    * except for the devtools eyedropper, which I am unsure what the devtools folks will need

    * Thanks kvark for reviewing!
    * Fixed a bunch of conformance tests (and bugs)
  * WebGL repo review backlog
    * Found and fixed a new crash from them!
  * Investigated WGL on dGPU with Optimus
    * Can't seem to get it to give me a valid GL context, alas.
    * We can create a DXGIAdapter for either just fine though, seems like.
      * Might be useful for cross-gpu rendering for WebGL's powerPreference.
