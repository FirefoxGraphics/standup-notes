  * CopyTexImage should error for snorm formats
  * Stop webgl redundantly clearing textures during clear+render-to-texture
  * Require a GL profile+version that supports constant-index-expression of sampler arrays in shaders
  * Waiting on Chrome Beta's next branch to revendor an updated ANGLE in for Nightly65.
  * Proposing allowing texture uploads for any ArrayBufferView type (e.g. webgl requires RGBA8 uploaded as Uint8Array)

  * investigating remaining webrender svg filter failure
    * need to support clipping before the filters are applied
    * otherwise it's hard to detectwhat cases are doable with webrender without conservatively ruling most cases because prim subregion is almost but not quite compatible
  * taking the rest of the day off

miko
  * Crunching on hit test items (still)

kats:
  * various reviews, needinfos
