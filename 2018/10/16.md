nical
  * lots of reviews
  * will mis the daily
  * looking at the remaining branches after dxc optimizations. mostly alpha shortcut and saturation code
    * interestingly the saturation filter looks like it is slightly different in skia and WR:
      * skia doesn't use the middle component in set_sat or somehow they manage to compensate for not computing the middle component.
      * digging.
        * in fact we can still ponder why the code is different but it's not timing sensitive
    * only alpha can affect timing, assuming we can turn an iframe's rgb channels into alpha values that we then feed into mix blend modes.
