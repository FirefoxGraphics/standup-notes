* will miss daily
* posted data on OMTP OSX memory regression and thought about potential other mitigations
* looked into cbindgen/syn parse error, dtolnay fixed it upstream after I filed an issue
* need to update cbindgen to syn 0.12 to get it, but 0.12 breaks just about everything in the API
* got through about half the compile errors
* investigated flashing animation reported by user, looks like due to async image decoding
* OMTP seems to make this worse

* fixed bug with blob image fonts not getting cleaned up on WR shutdown
* tried to reproduce bug with font hinting in WR not matching Gecko on Windows, but failed to repro
* investigating issue with subpixel anti-aliasing not working for Bugzilla on Linux only when e10s is enabled

kats:
* did a bit of investigation on bug 1430787, fennec crash on the sticky-position reftest i was trying to add
* put up patches for bug 1430589
* spent a bunch of time digging into bug 1425451, trying to identify what data WR actually needs to produce a consistent hit-test result. results are unexpected/nonsensical
* turned on media mochitests on windows-qr

jnicol
* triage
* investigating 1431347 (android crash)
* clipping mask draw targets for blobimages

kvark:
* busy at CoE 3
* WR capture stuff

jrmuizel
* blob image invalidation
* ran into the fact that the dlbi doesn't cover all the cases and relies on layer tree invalidation to handle some cases
* have a solution implemented that should handle layer tree invalidation cases
* it's not beautiful but seems to mostly work
