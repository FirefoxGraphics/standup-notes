nical
* had a coffee tasting in the office
* documents documents documents (and their offsets)
* plan: a document for the ui on top of the content document

* try to figure out resizing properly

rhunt
* landed about:support information for parallel OMTP
* looking into adding support for diagnostics missing in AL like draw-tile-borders
* looking into performance of parallel OMTP
* rasterflood talos benchmarks don't show a large difference
* discovered that's because they are sized to within a single tile
* changing the test to width from 200->700px shows a 2.2x improvement
* going to try and change the tests before landing parallel OMTP on OSX

kats:
* landed WR update
* testing patch to turn WR hit-testing. ran into a manifest parser bug that took me a while to figure out/work around
* wrote a fix for the transform regression i caused, bug 1432541. the fix turns out to fix a bunch of other reported issues as well
* decided it might be a good idea to make the WR structs have constructors so we can be sure we're initializing all the members and not sending garbage into WR. wrote a cbindgen patch to do that, and then discovered we IPDL the structs so we need the no-arg construction

jnicol
* bit more progress with blobimage large mask layer bug (1429508) have it working I think but with ugly hack that needs tidied
* investigating android layers security crash

* WebRenderUserData is not keyed by type this causes us to clobber ourselves.
