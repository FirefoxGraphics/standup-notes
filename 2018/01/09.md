kvark (unable to attend the call)
* mostly looking at the flickering bug
* what we see is R8 render target used where RGBA8 is expected
* (rust) code seems to behave correctly - no amount of checks and assertion detect the mismatch
* only seen in Release builds
* improving reftest framework for our Vk portability implementation

rhunt
* uplifting a OMTP crash fix
* OMTP OSX memory regression pit of despair

gankro
* found bug in synthetic bold (lee fixed as soon as I explained it to him)
* adding synthetic bold tests to wrench (had none, even though supported)
* reviewing patches
* starting to look into windows CI text snapping issues

lee
* investigated WR reftest failures w/ FreeType hinting
* investigated FreeType race condition/crash in blob image
* fixed WR synthetic bold bug on Mac 
* WR writing modes
* landed WR synthetic italics

jrmuizel
* blob image debugging
* most of the bugs are in my assertions being bad :)
* freetype race condition stuff with lee

jnicol
* have simple fix for max surface size issue
* since this needs uplifted to beta don't want to make any large changes
* working on more involved fix

nical
* Lost half of today to the magics of Shmem serialization in IPDL
* the refcounted shmem stuff (take 3) should work (need a try push, up for review soon)
* rebasing the transactions stuff, addressing reviews, etc.

botond
* continuing to investigate bug 1416847 (scrollbar dragging issue with WR) 
* in the process discovered another scrollbar dragging issue with WR, filed as bug 1428931

kats:
* looked into bug 1387340 (popup windows rendering with wrong scale on multi-monitor setups), have a patch for more testing
* looked into the crash regression 1428765 from clip deduplication. can repro but os x  only (i.e. no rr) so debugging is slow
* looked into the high cpu usage from apz keyboard scrolling code. discovered that it appears to be useless so i think should be easy to fix.
