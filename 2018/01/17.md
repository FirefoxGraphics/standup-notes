* patch to fix a crash with unreasonably large compositor windows
* looked at another crash which seems to be caused after we fail to render into a mask layer
* can paper over it but hard to tell if it will crash elsewhere
* no repro, no testcase and low volume lately so maybe not worth papering over for now
* reviews
* rebased transaction PR

* some more investigating blob image playback too-large-drawtarget panic (1429508)
* some triage
* going to look at 1430550 - android mutex crash caused by omtp changes

kats:
* tried landing bug 1426386, that got backed out (twice)
* landed WR update
* investigated a regression from the clip deduplication patches i landed. mattwoodrow found the root cause, need to fix
* wrote a patch to move the APZ scroll offset update into a transaction, got it landed and backed out
* fixed regression causing fall back to basic compositor on OS X

jrmuizel
* blob image invalidation bug fixes:
* one of the invalidation cases was generating wrong rectangles
* tracked down a leak of display item data that was causing us to have stale rects
* there's still an issue that has to do with bounds changes on wrapping items (going to look at that today)
* noticed a possible FLB performance improvement

botond
* bug 1429373 (scrollbar dragging regression from bug 1168263 (APZ support for perspective transforms)) 
* fixed the hit-testing problem, but there's a second problem 
* need to add another hack to APZ code related to perspective transforms 
* longer-term solution (mattwoodrow): have perspective create a stacking context 
* talked to :mstange about bug 1425243 (CompositorOGL bug affecting transformed masks) 
* half day PTO
