aosmond
* been looking into the memory differences, collected some data using valgrind massif; not much to share at this point
* bug 1446309 (image flickering with WR) -- looks like we don't fallback to the old image container if the new image doesn't have a fully decoded image on WR path
* bug 1388020



kats (will miss daily, dentist appt):
* wrote a double-tap-to-zoom mochitest, patches are up
* WR update
* landed another round of APZ threading changes
* got final set of patches for bug 1441324 cleaned up, to move the APZ controller thread to the GPU process main thread. this clears the way for moving the APZ sampler thread to the render backend



rhunt
