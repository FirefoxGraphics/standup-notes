* confirmed my suspicions about the clipping bug in wr
* a prim is segmented during a frame and a clip render task allocated for it
* on a subsequent frame we end up in a config where the primitive would not have been segmented but we keep the segments
* we then assume that the thing is not segmented (or at least don't have the right data in the source clip that the segment reads from).

* responded to some ni?'s
* found cause of tscrollx regression with parallel tiled skia on windows
* still have a 20% tresize regression, looking into that now



kats:
* triaged wpt failures on linux64-qr
* continued working on the APZ threading changes, realized we probably need to use the scene builder thread rather than the RB thread for APZ. will implement some more of that to make sure



botond
* reviews: bug 1447157, bug 1428387 (mentored)
