* bug 1435291 (background SVG uses fallback) -- landed
* this seems to have improved our talos AWSY numbers quite a bit, although it still leaves a large gap with non-WR; the tries from bug 1444946 / the next WR update are an improvement again, but the measurements are still anywhere from 2x (explicit) to 3x (resident) to 10x (heap); will investigate this further
* bug 1445802 (Windows QR MDA tests assert)
