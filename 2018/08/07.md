  * advanced layers flicker - very close to figuring it out
  * requested uplift for that d2d glyph cache bug

nical (read-only):
  * investigating incorrect blur in wr
  * trying to find a way to reduce the amount of stuff that gets in captures
    * thought I found a bug with lots of transparent items but they are placeholders for hitesting (too bad because they take a quite a bit of space in the capture)
    * ended up manually discarding items in WebRenderAPI.cpp when in teh parent process,
    * if you have any workflow that helps with this, please document it in https://github.com/servo/webrender/wiki/Debugging-WebRender

rhunt
  * Testing out capture command list flushing, about to push it
  * Getting FillGlyphs merging ready for review

kats:
  * continued working on async tab switching. my first attempt at pre-rasterization crashes due to message ordering, investigating
  * needinfos, reviews

lee (read-only)
  * optimizing missing glyph rendering

miko
  * Looked into parent process retained DL, linux debug failures on try that cannot be (at least easily) reproduced locally
  * Invalidation fix is waiting for nsRegion overflow fix by Bas, bug 1480832
  * GetLayerState() shows up high on FLB profiles for DL mutate test, looks like a relatively easy optimization opportunity

jrmuizel
  * Looked into low webrender shield study enrolment
  * came up with 3d transforms with blob image plan
