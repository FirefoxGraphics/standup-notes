  * Need to revive the RGBA/BGRA subject
    * WebGL in some configurations passes its content to the compositor through a readback in RGBA format
    * some android devices don't support BGRA
    * some platforms prefer BGRA (Windows?)
    * webrender's gl device kinda support RGBA but not really (just enough to not crash and render things the wrong way)
    * I'm a little confused about what exactly are gecko's assumptions about BGRA if any
  * looking into tab switching with wr
  * looked at the blur filer clipping issue, emilio will take over
  * triage duty
