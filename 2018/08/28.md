  * UK holiday yesterday
  * have fix for advanced layers flicker up for review

kvark
  * WebGPU call
  * bulk hiring meeting
  * WR documenting the chasing infra
  * WR perspective division bug

nical
  * made the low priority scene builder optional and rebased it on top of the gecko side patches
  * crashes due to reordering of set_display_list messages
    * could come back to messaging the render backend thread before sending to the scene builder like kats' original patch queue
    * or move the pending scene data structure to the scene builder (would avoid copying it over each time).

rhunt
  * got cross process painting working well, can snapshot the whole e10s browser
  * getting it ready for review and testing it

miko
  * Fixing nits for frame overflow area fix, bug 1483659
