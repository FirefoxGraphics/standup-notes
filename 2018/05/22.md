* bug 1382683 (fix GIF decoder performance regressions) -- finished writing patches/new gtests, up for review
* bigger improvement observed on Mac (41% reduction in decode time on my 2013), might be part of why Mac users have been complaining of higher CPU usage
* bug 1462431 (expand scope of downscale on decode) -- tried landing, but after some investigation, it seems web platform reftests use downscale on decode
* this is unlike regular reftests, but obviously there is some resistance to changing the tests to be less like what we ship
* working on the proper implementation of the animation frame buffer recycling
