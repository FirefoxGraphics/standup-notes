* completed triage, fixed a few simple bugs in the process
* helped out with looking into video playback performance with software codecs
* looks like we run into slow stuff with intel on mac with our anive glTexImage + composite code. when using the AMD gpu power consumption drops dramatically, chrome runs fine either way.



jnicol
* investigating github layerization
* reading advanced layers code

* WR document scissor/placement + servo
* WR blob image invalidation
* Szeged + WebGPU/Google calls
* VkPi subresource layouts

- still lots of fluid so we might be inducing early. At the hospital this morning



aosmond
* bug 1462650 (encode scaled image improvements) -- updated some tests due to scaling changes, landed on inbound
* bug 1382683 (improve GIF decoding time) -- landed on inbound
* bug 1463400 (image flashing) -- investigating, I think it is because the srcset switches images when you resize, and it doesn't keeping showing the previous until decoding is done like it should
* more frame recycling rework, thinking about buffer sync story with WR





tanushree:
* working on bug 1423011 with Kashav 
* Worked with Markus to understand how viewport dimensions are calculated by examining the minimap
* TODO:
* Follow-up with botond about questions 
* Modify minimap code to include a visual viewport 



kats:
* wrote some methods to flush the different parts of the WR pipeline that I thought would fix the problem, but it just made things intermittent instead of permafail
* landed fix for bug 1462903, so that we always have some pipeline content for WR for async images
* turned on mochitests for opt builds on windows-qr, bug 1464181



botond
* discussions with Tanushree and Kashav about APZ architecture and intern project 
* discussion of C++ object lifetime management proposals on dev-platform 
* provided some clarifications in bug 1423013 (content that overflows the ICB is "out of reach") 
* around round of review on bug 1455182 (mentored bug) 
* looked a bit more at bug 1459696 (compositor hit testing bug), need to discuss with Markus a bit
