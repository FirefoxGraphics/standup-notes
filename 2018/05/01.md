* enabled parallel tiling when we are using skia on windows on nightly
* so far so good
* wrote a patch to add about:support information for this feature
* my potential fix for vsync issue did not help, unsure what to pursue next
* i don't think it's a cause of WaitForVBlank returning immediately because vsync is still 'active'
* the logs indicate that we fire the vsync event about 10 times in 0.1-0.2ms succession, which should be well after the vsync event is over
* running on the same aws instance type doesn't reproduce the issue for me, might be some config on it
* investigating bug 1420865 - rotated buffer corruption with a web extension. not sure what's up yet

kats:
* rebased the clipping rewrite and cleaned it up a little. seems to be pass 4 more tests with no regressions, so it's up for review
* looking at some scrollbar regressions from a change a month ago. have a fix for one, testing it now

aosmond
* bug 1456558 (factor of 2 scaling + vector images)
* got this mostly working, only can kick in if a few properties are satisfied, seems to help with smoothness on makeyourmoneymatter.org
* looking into how SVGs work on Chrome to compare

jrmuizel
