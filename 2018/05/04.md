rhunt
* will be gone today
* memory investigations with parallel skia tiling
* tracked down cause of rotated buffer corruption with a webext (bug 1420865)
* layer->MayResample() on client and shadow side can return different values
* this happens if the ancestor layers of a ref layer have MAY_CHANGE_TRANSFORM as client side doesn't know about them
* client validates visible bounds if MayResample()
* shadow assumes MayResample() means the whole visible bounds are valid
* this can lead to shadow painting invalid content
* not sure what the best fix is here, please comment on the bug if you have an opinion
