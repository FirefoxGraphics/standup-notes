kvark
* WR tiling code review/fixes
* WR near plane split - getting all the deps in shape (tests, publish)



sotaro
* Removed WrExternalLogHandler
* It is not necessary any more, since GeckoLogger handles rust logging
* Updated reset handling of GLLibraryEGL. Waiting for a review.
* Implementing shader disk cache.



aosmond
* half day PTO yesterday
* harassment training
* landed patches to not advance animated images not in view (CPU/battery wins!) and to re-enable discarding for large animations on 62
* landed SourceBuffer improvements, need to monitor telemetry to ensure our average number of chunks for an image doesn't increase too much
* wrote patch to add additional requirement before discarding frames (loop length of the animated image)
* not sure if I want to land yet, but wanted ready as we have observed some very large but tight animations which discard



rhunt
* startup crash in AWSY test led me to update my mozbuild and VS and do a clobber
* updating VS led me to run into the new ICE
* windows update corrupted my build working around it
* none of that fixed the startup crash of course
* minidump wasn't be symbolicated/stack dumped properly and it was being deleted instantly
* managed to hack marionette to copy it to a safe place and examine it in VS
* startup crash is bug 1460077
* but now DMD is startup crashing, decided to just try and do this over try
* also got performance numbers with POMTP tiling



jrmuizel
* looking at getting nical's tile decomposition landable
* fixed a bug in it
* rebased it
* trying to address some review comments and add better tests
* had converstations with mstange and others about the path to killing frame layer builder
* See https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/wr-future for our notes



jnicol
* fixed some reftest errors. still working on the remaining ones



kats:
* turned on OSX QR reftests, bug 1322845
* discussed some hit-testing stuff with mstange and Gankro
* also discussed APZ zooming for desktop stuff with mstange
* started working on paint skipping support for WR, bug 1452390



lee
* reviews
* still studying WR scrolling
* revising WR subpixel positioning



gankro
* trying to make more stuff work in const-fns
* svg hittesting with kats + mstange



botond
* investigation of various incoming APZ bugs (bug 1456938 (nested sticky), bug 1428030 (Android jumping), bug 1459506 (Linux trackpad scrolling)) 
* thought more about containerless zooming (bug 1459312); it looks like the APZ changes required may be non-trivial
