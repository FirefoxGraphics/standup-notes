* looking into avoiding blocking thre render backend thread when rasterizing blob images
* I think that a good start is to render visible blob tiles during scene building
* requires knowing visibility information at that point
* benefits meeting

* fixed (hopefully) the last reftest failure for DisplayItemData patch.
* profiling a bad web page

* Debug the crash

* after some iteration got dmd working on try, have to addr2line locally
* it looks like the heap unclassified regression is from the skia glyph cache
* not sure why that has changed significantly
* explains why memory use goes back down after the GC/memory pressure event
* did an experiment with a rust library for codegen'ing c++ for cbindgen



gankro
* isolating/writing tests for regressions



lee
* chasing down WR subpixel positioning bugs



kats:
* fiddled with the animation reftests enough to be able to land the GetLastTransactionId patch, bug 1437036
* landed the empty transaction patches (bug 1452390), investigating autoscroll regression from it
* bisected bug 1459760 which involved some local builds
* fixed another deadlock scenario in bug 1460988
