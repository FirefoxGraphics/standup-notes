  * still not figured out windows memory leak.
    * i think the reason it affects this page with inactive layers but not active ones, is because with active layers the layers only last about 5 seconds each, and new layers (and therefore draw targets) are being created and destroyed.
    * whereas with inactive layers they all share a draw target which remains alive forever.
    * if I force D3D11TextureData::BorrowDrawTarget to create a new draw target every time, the leak no longer occurs
    * so perhaps rendering a glyph is leaking while the d2d device/draw target remains alive
    * I'm working on making a reduced test case

nical (will probably miss the daily)
  * fix for the huge border corner dots/dash issues and followup review comment addressed
  * trying to find other ways to break wr with big things
  * followup patch to improve invalidation with async blobs (but want to hold off until async blobs are landed and stable before landing it)
  * fix for #2808 (debug shader comilation crash)
  * fix for #2919 (something about wrench and illegal window titles)
  * on PTO next week

  * talked with kats about the telemetry we're hoping to give us results from the shield study
    * landed some new telemetry to make the shield study more correct
  * learned how to do webrender updates from kats
  * looked into excesive clipping with WebRender
  * gathered some webrender feedback from reddit
    * have some new things to fix

rhunt
  * wrote a patch to use paint thread instead of workers when tiling with paint-workers=1 for it's stack size
    * should fix OSX 10.9 crash and let us use some OMTP
  * finished telemetry probe clean up patches
  * talos investigation with P-OMTP on linux

miko
  * Landed transforms flattening, bug 1462672
  * Investigating talos regression caused by invalid clipping

tanushree:
  * basic implmentation for Visual Viewport API
    * TODO: intent to implement and testing 
  * intern presentation slides 

botond
  * intern project 
    * discussed Visual Viewport API implementation with Tanushree 
    * Part 2 patches landed! 
    * discussions with Kashav about Part 3 patches, follow-up work on async zooming, and other loose ends 
    * discussion with Simon from the Safari team about zooming out past the ICB 
  * discussion of <web_view> (C++ standards proposal) with various people 
  * brief investigation on bug 1468410; ruled out APZ and main-thread hit testing as causes (looks like an event handling issue) 
  * provided guidance on mentored bug 1451461 (improvements to pinch locking) 
  * started implementation work on bug 1457586 (Android initial fling velocity computation)
