nical:
 * figured out a way to deal with cases where gecko sends incorrect visible areas for blob images
  * during frame building, collect missing blob images (or blob image tiles), keep a blob rasterizer with the right state for the frame's current transaction and rasterize missing blobs on demand
  * just ported the gecko side over to the new system, seems to work
 * WebReplay reviews

tanushree:
 * solved overflow-hidden bug 
 * The test is also failing because of a zooming test failure
 * Meetings with Erica and David
