aosmond
  * bug 1464927 (animated SVG in taskbar broken) -- wrote patch, up for review
  * did some code reviews, investigations into some apparent image cache misses for new Clear-Site-Data header tests (ongoing)
  * viewing large images janky
    * we reupload the whole texture when only a small bit changes
    * imagelib has the information but doesn't provide it because
      * it doesn't use UpdateExternalImage instead of regenerating the image key and using AddExternalImage
      * UpdateExternalImage doesn't expose a way to provide a dirty rect
