  * bug 1501794 (img.decode API) -- finished up review changes, back up for review
  * bug 1509408 (animated image recycling regression) -- investigating, looks like the recycle rect was miscalculated
    * also wrote a patch to improve memory reporting to break out explicitly whether an animation frame is retained, discarding, or recycling

nical
  * investigated reftest differences with my dirty rect patches
    * the tests don't run any blob or image code so it' s very likely coming from another PR
  * rebased the PR
  * looking into the gecko parts to try to stop invalidation the whole blob image when changing the visible area
  * triage duty

jrmuizel

miko
  * Did a couple of reviews
  * Fixed bug 1504924 to improve performance when checking whether to apply opacity to text items
  * Wrote a quick and dirty patch for bug 1490404 to get some information how RDL is working, and why it fails when it does
  * Discussed RDL telemetry with Matt, paint phase distribution with intel does not really match the baseline
  * Investigated RDL usage with WR, got bit by bug 1458993, which is now fixed
  * Looking into replacing nsDisplayItem::In3DContextAndBackfaceIsHidden() with nsDisplayItem::BackfaceIsHidden() as this would improve both DL building and WR command building

kats:
  * wrote a patch for one of the fuzzer crashes, couldn't repro two others. a fourth one might be fixed by the ChooseScaleAndSetTransforms patch
  * landed WR code move in m-c, now stuff is in gfx/wr
  * prepping patches for linux CI on treeherder, should start putting them up for review today
  * success in getting a WR capture on android
  * did an opt-level=3 talos run, no significant improvement sadly
  * WR updates
