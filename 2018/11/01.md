kats:
  * trying to fix clipping when zoomed in WR on GeckoView. think it might require invasive changes on the WR side
    * will try markus' suggestion first, to use an animated scale transform

miko
  * Hit test changes got r+, fixing some nits regarding display item memory usage
  * Found a cause for bug with flattening of inactive transforms, subpixel AA needs to be disabled for animations

rhunt
  * investigating a user report of VRAM leaking from resizing from a OMTP change a while back
    * not sure if it's still happening
  * addressed review comments and landed patch to not cancel animations when receiving a relative update
  * landed crash fix for intermittent caused by GPU process change
    * got temporarily backed out under suspicion of causing the nightly logout bug
