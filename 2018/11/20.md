  * addressing review feedback for adreno texture cache workaround
    * it seems like my workaround still doesn't work on adreno 3xx devices, in which case I think doing the glCopyImageSubData workaround is a better plan.

  * some sec bug shepherding
  * wrangled some driver bugs
  * looked at some slow frame profiles
  * started work on choosing the right scale (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1415987)
  * our webrender serialization code quality seems to have regressed. Not sure why yet but found an unrelated problem https://github.com/TyOverby/bincode/pull/256

aosmond
  * prepped / landed some webp followups
    * bug 1508270 (libwebp wasn't marked for exclusion from the clang format bits, whoops)
    * bug 1507691 (we weren't advertising webp when requesting the document itself, just images)
  * bug 1508393 (generate full frames by default)
    * had to investigate broken test in order to land the pref test, discarding and restarting images with full frames was actually broken
    * landed and should make the next nightly (minutes too late last night to make the current sigh)
    * on a related note, now fixing the last broken test for WR + recycling to land, want a nightly to contain only bug 1508393 first
  * spent time looking into my reftest and if the separate leaf bug fix would actually fix it (it was related, but no)

kvark

    * good conversation with emilio about some implementation details

kats:
  * finally got a working patch for bug 1503029, intermittent scrollbar dragging failure
  * made progress on the taskcluster stuff, now have patches for doing webrender CI on linux in taskcluster/treeherder
  * applied jamie's patch for blitting on android and tested on different devices (works on Adreno 540, not on 330)
  * trying to get profiles and captures from android GVE

miko
  * More work on bug 1504233, the problem seems to be ASR changing during DL merging, trying to understand how the code should work

nical
  * still making gecko changes for the BlobImage stuff
