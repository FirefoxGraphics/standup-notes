aosmond
  * fixed a few bugs in the WebP integration, wrote more test cases to cover those
  * landed support for async animated images; it performs as promised and avoids scene rebuilding, but now I'm finally preparing the final set of changes to get recycling working with WR to avoid the allocation cost (which is substantial)
  * put another ClipManager crash fix up for review. we are inconsistent on when we expect get a valid scroll ID vs when we actually create them

kats:
  * tested nested cargo workspaces, seems to work fine, for our purposes anyway
  * implemented zooming using an animated transform like mstange suggested, seems to work well. still need some tweaking though
