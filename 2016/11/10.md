* GPU process device resets were landed
* Looked into a Canvas2D crash more
* Started work on detecting if we are getting spammed by device resets and stopping that
* Looked into a refactoring for some compositor code



nical:
* texture cleanup landed
* working on external textures
* for the external texture callback api, we'll probably start with only texture handles and do texture uploads outside of WR

kvark:
* WR tiled mask generator: lots of deprecation cleanup: primitive metadata, clip shared source, mask data
* -//-: default render task for non-masked primitives
