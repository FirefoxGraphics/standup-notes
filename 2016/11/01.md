* bug 1311779 (starting decoders in BGRX when possible) landed, will collect telemetry on how often we can optimize remainding BGRA to BGRX in imagelib
* cleaning up / rebasing bug 1290293 (removing BGRX memset), get this in shape to land soon (once telemetry results come back)



mchang
* AMD opengl OES extensions driver bug on windows
* got windows to work, texture upload on windows just super slow compared to OS X

edwin
* #windowsworldproblems
* 1309277 - d3d9 sans component alpha
