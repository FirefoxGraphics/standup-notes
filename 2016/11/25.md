* bug 1320196 (OOM crash in ImageCacheKey::ComputeHash)
* when we copy the spec out of a URI, it seems to typically use a shared buffer for embedded images (e.g. data:image/png....) so there is no malloc
* but we did a string append in the hash calc which forced a malloc
* landed a fix avoiding the append/malloc
* bug 1319025 (optimized APNGs misrendered)
* crafted test images for mochitest, now up for review
