nical:
* Won't make it to the daily today
* finally got my patch that fixes theme rendering when the gtk theme is dark reviewed, landed, requested uplift (actually, it got backed out, investigating...)
* working on the canvas updates
* reviewed an accelerated video decoding patch in bug 1223270. Probably worth keeping an eye on device resets whenever it lands (I am not too worried but still)



kats:
* still on bug 1268195, groveling in the muck that is scroll position restore and frame reconstruction
* some quick fixes: bug 1268523, bug 1268517, bug 1268122



botond:
  - bug 735857 (background-attachment:fixed + transform) - requested aurora uplift
          - also considered beta uplifts for bug 735857 and bug 1257288 but decided against them
  - investigated bug 1267898, looking like an evangelism issue (scroll-linked effect used to simulate position:sticky)
  - bug 1267470 (move more fields from FrameMetrics to ScrollMetadata) - fixed gtest failure, landed
  - bug 1268009 (page not repainted with APZ disabled) - diagnosed, wrote patch, landed
  - looked a bit into the reftest harness creating untracked files in the srcdir
