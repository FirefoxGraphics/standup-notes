  - reviews: bug 1265424
  - bug 1260018 (drag sessions break scrolling) - finished implementing workaround approach, posted patch
  - bug 1219296 (scroll snapping in the compositor) improving GfxBench.CompositorSimpleTree: did a bit more perf investigation
  - looked into scroll snap bugs filed by Markus
          - bug 1265510 (scrolling nested frame interrupts snap) - seems to be specific to pan-gesture events
          - bug 1265513 (scroll snap inhibits handoff) - there are at least 3 issues
              - one I can't reproduce
              - one I posted a fix for
              - one I think is expected behaviour (needs discussion)
  - next: bug 1257288 (APZ hit testing does not take FrameMetrics clips into account)
