nical
* Diagnosed and fixed another shutdown issue
* got a bit frustrated about LayerComposite
* looking into reviving Bas' work on canvas



kats:
* working on bug 1266833 and the spinoff bug 1268195 that I uncovered while investigating.



ashughes
* triaged topcrash and explosiveness reports, filing two new low volume crash bugs: https://bugzil.la/1268202,1268155
* provided data analysis for https://bugzil.la/1267970 (atiumdag.dll crash)



acomminos
* Fixed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1258086
* Working on adding robustness to X11 window realize/unrealize for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1264454

* Looked more at 1264504. I suspect that 45.0.2 just got lucky in triggering some heuristic in a graphics driver to do something "helpful" and dumb. No crashes in 46.0; tossing up whether to investigate anyway but likely not worth it.
* Prodded at 1245747 more. Device reset wonkiness.

* subpixel AA text



jnicol
* looking into 1268076. more bad layerization causing oom, this time in skia because of canvas.
* however, only started in 46 so there might be something easily fixable



Bas:
* failing test that could be connected to the recent shutdown patch, but not sure - reproducible locally?
* landed D2D crash regression fixes
