Nical:
* I think I have child process shutdown at a point where it can land enabled on non-windows platform and not far from landable on windows
* We have a race when force-shutting down ipdl actors, I have an idea about how to fix it



jnicol
* more progress on 1247437 (flattening layer tree). working out what to do about apz when flattened.



Bas:
* white text landed, looking for uplift
* memory leaking, snapshots not doing a full flush



kats:
* landed the displayport tweaks (bug 1259593, bug 1251638, bug 1261062)
* landed conversion of some async-scrolling mochitests to being e10s-friendly (bug 1255022)
* converted a slew of image/test/mochitest chrome tests to mochitest-plain so they can run in e10s (bug 1261158)
* landed messageloop fix in bug 1257862 to hopefully fix the intermittent "scrolling stops working"
* going through APZ bugs marked affected:47 to see if they need to be fixed or can be deferred
