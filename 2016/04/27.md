nical
* looking into the shmurf allocator
* just using the naive allocator for all shmem allocations is wasteful, having a separate allocator for shmems and for other layers helps
* interestingly the tile pool plays against us in this case
* super scarry thing on google.com that cause us to continuously allocate textures and composite



jrmuizel
* figured out a plan for padding or not for video scaler and implemented it.
* still need to test it
* tried setting up ssh on windows for trevor
* was a disaster

gw280
* stuck in linker hell. the linux sandbox is a complete mess when it comes to where stuff is linked and to what, and it relies on a whole bunch of stuff being linked into the content process that isn't in the main binary
* spent two days wrestling with it. have it working right now, awaiting feedback.



BenWa:
* Waiting on gfxConfig to land
* Looking at bug 1251615 et al.
