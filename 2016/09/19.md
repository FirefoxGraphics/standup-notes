nical
* memory reporter patch backed out, investigating why



jnicol
* will land 1288446
* have speculative fixes for 1245959
* once those are up for review will look for another crash to investigate



edwin
* 925645 - bleh. still tracking down a reftest failure on windows with my patch. also running into an assertion i'm not sure is correct; will have to ask jgilbert later on.
* looking at 1293560 - crash while printing pages with certain asian fonts, from a gfxDevCrash I added a while ago. should be a quick fix.



aosmond
* 1303427 - put fix / test case up for review, broken corner case parsing truncated gifs
* 1294490 - webp, fixed B8G8R8X8 bug, added content sniffing/building against system lib patches, now up for review



kats:
* was in the office on friday - interviews, some webrender discussion, miscellaneous conversations
* continuing to work on bug 1298173



gw280
* Currently documenting how shmem works in IPC, because this is completely undocumented. We're also changing some stuff to aid GPU process work (likely adding an unmanaged shmem type)
* Looking at an assert in ImageBridgeParent

botond:
  - mentored bugs: 1285940, 1301126
  - interviewed candidate, wrote up evaluation, participated in debrief
  - scroll-driven animations
          - our draft spec (https://birtles.github.io/scroll-animations/) was circulated to other implementers
              - in turn, Google have a proposal of their own: https://github.com/drufball/generalized-animations
              - also another, which seems to be an (reduced-scope) iteration on CompositorWorker: https://github.com/majido/animation-worklet-proposal
          - prototype: new sampling model implementation
              - fixed memory leaks
              - next: write some test cases that create layout cycles to see how the model fares on them
