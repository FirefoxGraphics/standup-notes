gw280
* Bunch of reviews for TextureForwarder etc
* Finished up and published my intro to shmem blog. Mostly just concentrated on a high level overview with some info on internal mechanics/structure
* Investigating ShadowLayerForwarder Begin/EndTransaction crashes. Probably going to deal with it higher up in the stack, from ClientLayerManager.

botond:
  - scroll-driven animations
          - discussion with Brian
              - can't handle @trigger on the compositor thread (but could handle animation-trigger)
              - would be nice to have a way to trigger transitions on the compositor thread
          - prototype
              - wrote test cases for layout cycles, but some other parts of the prototype need to be implemented before they actually work
              - working through a few remaining issues in the sampling model implementation
  - half day PTO



mstange
* got WebRenderLayerManager to render colored boxes in the wrong positions
* https://github.com/mstange/gecko-dev/commit/60bc5cfcff691dfb13cdcba5f114c02a3492375d
* not sure how to reuse tiling / rotatedbuffer or whether we should even bother
* wrote a patch for bug 1303761, which improves the scrolled clip workaround to work on the BBC pages
