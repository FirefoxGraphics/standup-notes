* did some things to some bugs -- closed things, needinfos, etc.
* looked at bug 1026404 -- looks similar to the issue we saw in bug 1264505, but on a completely different gpu. ordered a device and have put it on hold until it arrives.
* looking at bug 1287676 -- crash in java land. looks like it might only be in 50, but there's not enough nightly/aurora volume to tell. still worth fixing before it hits release.



aosmond

* just wrote an update, but it looks like it was archived as yesterday's. oops.
* reviewed matt's texture patches, landed now
* looking at ImageBridgeParent issues; basically we hold a singleton for each process and when the GPU process dies we lose them all. investigating how this all works
* blocklist stuff for intel/d3d9
