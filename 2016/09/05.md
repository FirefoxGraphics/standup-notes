* working out what to do for canvas on aurora
* disabling copy-on-write canvas and only uplifting what affected the disabled code paths seems to be the simplest approach
* the alternative is to uplift everything (that's a lot of stuff)
* a patch that blocks the main thread during canvas allocation if the compositor is blocked (because of the half-assed refresh driver throttling)
* so. many. reviews.

* know rough cause + workaround for 1288446 (powervr crash) but looking for more specific
