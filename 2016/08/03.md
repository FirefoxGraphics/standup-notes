* repro'd 1291528 (linear gradient regression). didn't spend any time investigating it further, because...
* more reviews

* installed the windows dev toolchain to work on a crash that only reproduces on windows so far
* it also appears to only reproduce with optimized builds
* I have a theory
* looked at canvas performance
* improved canvasmark by 1.7% which does not catch up with the earlier 2.10% regression
* probably because we flush the DrawTarget earlier

* Wrote intermittent fixes
* Looking into viewport synchronization with mesa
* Mesa doesn't keep track of the window size other than what's specified in glViewport
* This can cause black windows for small popups using GLX when the window size changes between glViewport calls
