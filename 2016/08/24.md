sotaro
* Reduce tearing with basic layers on Windows(Bug 1259571): Fixed test failures and checked-in
* Mask bug(Bug 1289829): Fixed problem and merged to m-c
* basic_compositor_video (windows8-64) regression(Bug 1295927): merged to m-c
* Looked into servo and drawing diagrams.



David:
* compositor process with D3D9 and D3D11, minimal XPCOM
* Matt: should be able to start video decoding



aosmond
* bug 1276044 - looks like once a document is too old in our history, we will discard it and all decoded images in the surface cache
* but in the STR the next page one navigates to is that same page, causing the image to flash; thus this may not be a problem in of itself (unless something went wrong with the history)
* bug 1259498 - figuring out where the missing decode request is



kats:
* landed scroll position fixes
* updated patches for bug 1292572. working now, needs a bit more testing
* more investigation into the intermittent failures in bug 1282638



botond:
  - scroll-driven animations
          - set up shared repository for collaboration on prototype: https://hg.mozilla.org/users/bballo_mozilla.com/scroll-driven-animations
              - figuring out mercurial changeset evolution...
          - more work on prototyping
          - continued discussion with Brian to nail down some details



BenWa:
* Getting missing crash symbols for OSX



Bas:
* test failure - try doesn't test D2D except on 8.1, so the SVG to canvas issue wasn't getting caught
