* Looking into remaining intermittents on dual core machines
* Tests with a failure rate of >~30% have been addressed
* There are some high-volume ones remaining (>5%), but we can probably ship it

botond:
  - bug 1292290 (Fennec regression where images turn black)
          - tried to get a reliable regression range, without much luck (problem is quite intermittent, and may have been around for long and just gotten worse)
          - based on symptoms, looks like an imagelib issue
  - bug 1292571 (screen.width changes while zooming)
          - investigated, believe this is correct behaviour as per spec
          - there's implementation divergence: Firefox/IE/Edge vs. Chrome/Safari
              - filed spec issue: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/399
  - triaged various other bugs
  - scroll-driven animations
          - continuing design conversation with Brian; next thorny issue: Layout cycles
