* can now reproduce 1288446
* confirmed suspicion that this was due to skia upgrade changing the way in which it uploads texture data. investigating further



kats:
* fixed one intermittent failure (bug 1298084), made some headway on another (bug 1282638)
* backed out my previous long-press patch because it made a regression in non-e10s codepaths (bug 1298313). working on a better fix



lee
* fixed bug related to incorrect gamma settings in SkFontHost_cairo
* investigated image size bugs to be sure not caused by Skia switchover



edwin
* pto
* reviews.
* paging in state from last week.
* continuing self-torment from 925645.
* took a brief look at 1298576 -- crash from within ANGLE fragment shader parser. looks like some obscure integer overflow thing. (|INT_MIN % -1| is undefined, since it's defined in terms of |INT_MIN / -1|, which would cause an overflow).



mchang
* push / poplayer with tiling
* rust shared surfaces
* skia windows talos regressions



aosmond
* bug 981323 - while we downscale appropriately, we still need to buffer the full image size for progressive scans; looking at some libjpeg parameters to see impact on memory (including something similar to bug 854795 for extreme cases like this)



mstange
* wrote a patch for bug 1298509 - canvas filters not being updated properly when using document.open
* landed a few patches that I pulled out from the clip megapatch
* reviews
