* ... Skia content backout. Sheriffs unhappy with increased timeouts in some cases, so trying to diagnose cause. We're spending too much time in unnecessary clip stack validation in SkCanvas which can be easily disabled.

* looked at some telemetry for webgl and webrender. Split out some intel stuff
