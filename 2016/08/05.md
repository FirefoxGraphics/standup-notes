acomminos
* Still working on dual-core test machine intermittents
* Landed patch to disable GL layers on mesa software rasterizers, make layers.acceleration.force-enabled apply to the OPENGL_COMPOSITING feature
* Looking into issue with windows not updating using fglrx on Gentoo
* Apparently Gentoo bundles prefs with the default firefox useflags that enable GL layers by default. Huh.



lee
* reviews
* fuzzing Skia reftests
* upstreaming some blending changes to Skia required for content





ernest
* dxva -> gfxconfig investigation

  - bug 1287075 (visual glitch in Australis submenus, regression from bug 1273250)
          - diagnosed the problem, fixed by backing out one of the patches from bug 1273250 (supposed to be just a cleanup patch)
          - more proper fix forthcoming in bug 1214146
  - scroll-driven animations
          - prototyping OMTA support (bug 1289909)
