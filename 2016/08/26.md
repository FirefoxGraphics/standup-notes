nical:
* spotted something odd with the way gfxContext pops all of the clips, made a patch
* big patch that cleans up the canvas allocation code (now waiting for try results)
* the refreshDriver problem happens because the refresh driver doesn't actually wait forever if the compositor is not processing transactions, it throttles itself to 200ms per tick
* This is baaaaaaaad if we are painting tiles or use persistent buffer provider shared (we'll allocate new textures every 200ms we run out of memory)
* Tempting to just block the refresh driver, but then any bug where we miss a composite notification would break firefox badly without crashing
* could try to send pings to the compositor every 500ms or so if the composite notifications are not coming, although the refresh driver is a bit far from the ipdl stuff so I m not sure how to plumb that in yet.
* I have an errand to run, will miss the daily.



acomminos
* Working on X11 frame synchronization with GL compositor
* Was an issue with basic backend before, but rarer due to faster flips (as most GL commands get fenced on swapbuffers)
* Looking into r600 GL layers crashes on Ubuntu 14.04



lee
* reviews
* tracking down broken subpixel AA on Linux



mchang
* rust texture sharing
* skia on windows landed
* push / pop layer with tiling



kats:
* large number of new and spiking APZ intermittent failures over the past couple of days. investigating and fixing



jrmuizel
* looked at a security problem
* trying to reproduce crash issues for matt
* a smattering of reviews/ni's
* I discussed client storage



aosmond
* bug 1259498 - talos tests suggest a minor regression in overall performance, but with no perceivable gains, so will leave this for now
* bug 1282496 - reorganizing changes to make mostly complete fix reviewable/landable, with a followup to cover the last remaining case





BenWa:
* Fixed & landed multithreaded profiler issue, for profiling web workers
* Updated the profiler SDK to fix an IPC issue
