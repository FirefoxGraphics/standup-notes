* Fixed a path flattening bug
* My patch that fixed properly tracking the clip stack in CanvasRenderingContext2D may have caused measurable perf regressions (overhead of calling SetTransform?)
* I dearly regret getting in this situation where we have to track the clip stack outside of DrawTarget (source of most of the persistent buffer provider correctness bugs)
* Thinking of adding a SwapBuffer API to DrawTarget, so that the canvas always uses the same DT, and does not have to serialize clips and transforms, I haven't checked whether it would be possible with all backends
* this patch also fixed demoting the draw target to change the drawing backend, turns out we didn't notice the problem because it does not happen that often. not sure if it is worth being correct in this case...
* loads of triage, and needinfo, some reviews.
* I think I might have figured the use-after-free bugs out with canvas + buffer provider: destroying a SourceSurface after it has been used in a drawing command does not seem to have any kind of synchronization baked in (cairo would handle it with its internal ref counting, but maybe not other backends?).



Bas:
* landed SVG patch
* driver crash increase, trying to sort out what's going on



edwin
* sick yesterday
* patch up to fix test failures from bug 1291528
* poking at a crash in AndroidBridge::OpenGraphicsLibraries. looks like there's a race between the AndroidBridge being created and whatever horribleness is happening here.
