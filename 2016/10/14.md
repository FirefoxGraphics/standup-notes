nical
* \o/ finally managed to get the canvas stuff to work on Loic' s computer
* investigated the skiagl issue
* caused by the content process not notifying gfxPlatform of the compositor backend
* started looking at webrender's code



kats:
* discovered a typo in the patch I landed in bug 1301593
* did some more investigation on a video resizing issue for xidorn, bug 1295195
* pushed along the system addon for d3d9fallback
* took afternoon off since i wasn't feeling well



mchang
* fixed skia dwrite fonts
* looking at jeff / mstange webrender branch



jnicol
* got more sensible talos results for multi-tiled window background. does indeed seem to be a slight benifit
* revisiting work to minimise invalidations when single tile visible region changes (e.g. tab bar scrolling)



gw280
* Continuing telemetry stuff for GPU process
* Looking at adding Azure/Moz2D data to crash stats



kvark:
* implementing the shader side of mask-image
* rewriting the API/webrender code to route the mask via Clip/ClipRegion instead of StackedContext



jrmuizel
* looking into webrender vs gecko performance
* Tried to come up with some cases where webrenders approach would be worse than invalidation
* Wasn't able to come up any realistic cases but was able to construct some synthetic ones
* Ran webrender on sandybridge, it wasn't obviously terrible (even with llvm-pipe it wasn't unusable)



botond
  - interviewed a candidate, wrote up evaluation
  - reviews: bug 1291381, bug 1308627
  - wrote a fix for bug 1307557
  - more investigation on https://github.com/mozilla/rr/issues/1832 - turned out not to be an rr bug
  - continued investigating bug 1293125
          - a proper fix for the margin-collapsing issue is hard; potentially even spec issues at work
          - workaround is possible; posted a patch + reftest
  - bug 1204502 (mentored bug) picked up by Tanuja, gave initial guidance
