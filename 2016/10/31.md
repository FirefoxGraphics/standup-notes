kvark:
* WR shader transform logic (multiple issues found, text is now fixed)
* WR tiling optimization - investigation



jrmuizel
* mask layers now work in WR Firefox (hasn't landed yet)



gw280
* Landed half the telemetry stuff in anticipation for the gpu proc being enabled on nightly today
* Looked into what we need to do to test the gpu proc. Started off by requesting manual QA with current AV software.



lee
* reviews
* reviving Bas' analytic blur/box shadow code



mchang
* windows opengl / wr investigation



kats:
* got APZ async scrolling working in the WR branch (behind a pref). still some issues with clipping if you scroll too far down, will investigate that.
* put up patches for the test failures that were blocking GPU process, bug 1313170



botond:
  - bug 1180799 (momentum scrolling after a two-fingered pan) - gave guidance for fixing remaining issue
  - investigated but 1313610 (failure of assertion added in bug 1228210) but couldn't repro
  - continuing to go through animation-worklet use cases
          - have a parallax example working (bug 1100357 dependency)
          - working on hidey-bar example
          - categories of use cases not addressed: customizing timing functions, animating scroll offsets
