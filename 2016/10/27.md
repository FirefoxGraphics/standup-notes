* will uplift as far as possible
* another look at 1164027 (adreno oom crash) to see if it can be reduced further



lee
* reviews
* closing out random Skia bugs fixed by update

nical:
* split my canvas patches from before the wr workweek and put them up for review
* reviews
* the #2 top-crash on beta right now is the dreadful linked_list crash inside d3d11, went through the push log to find whatver could have caused it. I am out ideas but it's kind of urgent
* submitted a patch that adds a a few comments to webrender
* looked at the way servo integrates WR
* looked into gecko integration some more
* not sure we need an actual WRLayerManager on the compositor side, but we do need a PCompositorBridge, too many things depend on it
* we can probably get away with using a PipelineId per process and use that to let WR do the equivalent of the ref layer stitching



mchang

* had a conversation with devtools people about performance devtools; we're going to port the existing devtools perf tools to the new cleopatra and make cleopatra the main tool for platform developers + partners, and then maybe create a web developer targeted version from that
* landed a few things + requested uplift
