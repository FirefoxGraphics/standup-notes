* aaaaaaauuuuuuauuarrrrrrggggh
* 1253386 - canvas timing badness. tried solving with texture recycling stuff, but gremlins abound. will probably go with suggested naive approach of ADD MOAR BUFFERS



nical:
* reviews, needinfos
* shm allocator stuff
* massive ISurfaceAllocator cleanup 



jnicol
* triage
* OOM layer flattening. starting to get something that sorta works



kats:
* spent some time trying to investigate an e10s-ported test failure in bug 1255022
* looked into bug 1256341/bug1256344 to figure out a good fix
* bunch of bug cleanup/uplifting etc



botond:
  - reviews: bug 1255997, bug 1227231 (mentored bug, using tree traversal algorithms for loops over the Layer tree)
  - some investigation into bug 1256341 / bug 1256344 (APZ gesture related crashes on desktop and fennec)
  - requested m-a and m-b uplifts to bug 1248822 (LayerManagerComposite change)
  - bug 1255214 (constant invalidation of scrollbar button)
          - debugged with rr (with Markus' help), wrote up diagnosis and outline of fix
  - discussed event regions performance issues with BenWa
  - helped :rbarker diagnose bug 1247964 (fennec scroll handoff assertion)



lee
* fixing Canvas2D drawWindow crash
* investigating canvas double-buffering bugs



mstange
* tried a low impact fix for bug 1214146, had some problems, need proper fix



BenWa:
* Gfx microbenchmarks
* Events region performance for IE maze (perhaps related to APZ talos regressions)
