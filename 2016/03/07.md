kats:
* got some results from the telemetry experiment. they are sad-making - reducing the displayport size increases checkerboarding, it seems.
* wrote a patch to fix the test failures in bug 1192910 so we can paint less while apz scrolling. pending review
* wrote patches for bug 1253860 so we can paint less while main-thread scrolling if apz is enabled. need to make tests pass on it, and also look at the talos numbers to see how much it helps.
* posted my patch for bug 1252262, waiting for review
* spent some time working on bug 1189901 (new talos test for apz) as well, made some progress but nothing ready yet



acomminos
* Had to backout GLX vsync patches due to a similar hang we were getting with Talos and the GL compositor
* good news is, we have a reduced test case for it now!
* Hang is happening when we block to shutdown the vsync thread
* Suspect it has something to do with thread local storage and the GLX context, not sure though
