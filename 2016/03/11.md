kats:
* spent half the day making not much progress on the remaining issue in bug 1242690, ended up landing it and will continue on that
* more talos investigations, put up a couple of patches up for review that help (bug 1254273, bug 1216924)
* modified a bookmarklet to hopefully provide a measure of jank on live pages (for bug 1252822)



Nical:
* Wrote a simple general-purpose allocator backed by shmems we can either :
* go for this one and use it for all or most layer allocations (would really benefit stupid sites with lots of small layers like treeherder)
* or stick with the fixed-size allocator that I wrote for tiles and video frames specifically (less risks of fragmentation but we don't get any benefits for sites with lots of small layers).
* The general purpose allocator is *very* simple which means it won't scale well to thousands of allocations (although 1 shmem per allocation is arguably even worse for this use case).



botond:
  - reviews: bug 1253860
  - bug 1253678 (conflict between mozilla::Function and mozilla::dom::Function)
          - diagnosed problem, posted a suggested solution approach
  - discovered and filed bug 1255214 (constant invalidation of scrollbar button)
          - tried to debug it with rr, with Markus' help, but ran into some rr issues; will try building a newer rr
  - investigated bug 1255068 (APZ scrolls content too fast in some cases)
          - posted diagnosis to the bug
  - bug 1219296 (shipping scroll snap points to the compositor)
          - finished preparatory refactoring (splitting things not needed for repaint requests out of FrameMetrics)
  - started looking at MozReview bug 1177944 (option to disable reviewer deduction)



lee
* OS X + Skia with Mason
* fixing Skia crash in release
* optimization for case where perspective transforms could be handled as plain old 2D transforms



mchang
* skia reftest failure due to differences in layout bounds on e10s vs non-e10s



jnicol
* starting work on 1247437 (flatten layer tree if we oom due to complex layer tree)



mstange
* diagnosed D3D11 APZ artifacts (component alpha layers with intermediate surfaces and APZ-expanded visible regions were refusing to copy the background, so not clearing the garbage in their intermediate surface) and landed a workaround (bug 1251894)



Bas
* Some discussions partaining bug 1251431
* Some more work on region code



edwin
* patch up for 1253995; need to address feedback.
* triage.
