Nical:
* because of an IPDL issue I decided to reimplement the actor stuff outside of IPDL (mostly a hashmap in each process, don't freak out!)
* That's super annoying but if we decide to do some non-ipdl ipc we'll have it and I need it now for the cross process allocator



edwin
* hacking together a fix for 1253995 as suggested by seth; root cause seems to be more feature than bug.



Bas
* Worked on a region class not based on pixman code
* Looked into an 46 regression caused by me in SVG



jnicol
* layery memory things again, not much progress



lee
* investigating upscaling during yuv decode and related pixman fast-path issue



kats:
* landed a whole slew of patches - test fixes, talos improvements, misc things.
* continuing to work on talos improvements for APZ



botond:
  - C++ standards meeting last week; stay tuned for blog post!
  - reviews: bug 1249937 (mentored), bug 1219980, bug 1251608, bug 1253739
  - helped Jeff investigate bad checkerboarding on GitHub: filed bug 1251638
  - continued conversation with BenWa about avoiding lagging behind with painting during scrolling
          - evaluating alternative approaches: shared memory and dedicated IPC queue
  - bug 1219296 (shipping scroll snap points to the compositor)
          - looked at scroll snapping spec and current implementation, outlined two possible approaches
              - based on people's feedback, going with approach #1
          - spec is undergoing changes; as we're designing this, want to keep the new spec in mind as well
          - working on some preparatory refactoring (splitting things not needed for repaint requests out of FrameMetrics)
            so the snap point info shipped to the compositor doesn't bloat repaint requests unnecessarily
  - MozReview: bug 1231397 (allowing auto-publish without prompt)
          - landed patch, hope it sticks!
          - landed follow-up test fixes
          - next MozReview bug: bug 1177944 (option to disable reviewer deduction)
  - bug 1210117 (APZ mochitest intermittent failure)
          - posted simple fix patch based on Kats' diagnosis
  - landed bug 1248822 (order of LayerTreeInvalidation and PostProcess in LayerManagerComposite::UpdateAndRender)



mstange
