kats: (plumber coming, I might not stay for whole meeting)
* landed bug 1273137

* reviews



botond [going to miss meeting]
  - relanded bug 1276107 (event regions fixes + tests + test footgun fix)
          - was backed out due to rebase error; fixed and relanded
  - got ccache and icecc working together: now have <2min ccache builds, ~4min icecc clobber builds, <4min icecc "RefPtr" builds
  - bug 1277814 (zero resolution --> bad displayport) - implemented a fix approach, wrote an APZ mochitest
  - put together a patch for bug 1277298 (store 'scrollgrab' more efficiently)
  - wrote proof-of-concept patch for bug 1259781 (autoscrolling goes wacky)
