IRC questions:


DONE Channel security and do not tweet


DONE If I want to contribute to Quantum, is there a person at all I can talk to?  I have loads of questions, but I basically don't know any venue I can ask half of them beyond next week, and that kinda sucks.


DONE is the goal of Quantum to last in long term goals, or just a temporary project until stability issues of Gecko are dealt with?


DONE why we're even considering and/or doing pepper flash in the first place?
