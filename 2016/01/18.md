Bas:
* resize buffers limits landed
* skia conversations



Nical:
* shmem deserialization bug
* int32 ids = worrying
* we don't handle some shmem deserialization errors



BenWa:
* Looked at more winclang issues
* Reproduced the D3D9 issue. It's an upload performance issue. We're taking a different upload path and it's a lot slower then it should be. Still investigating why
* Rebased and landed my patch to add --repeat and --run-until-failure to reftest
* Landed my patch to remove the FPO flag from win64, add label for D3D9 texture performance
* Worked on the RR GdbServer over the weekend



jrmuizel:
* Not going to make the daily
* Fixed and upstreamed an llvmpipe crash that happens while running webgl2 tests
* nsTArray now supports initializer_list initialization
* Started fighting the mesa test failures on insfrastructure. Failing so far.

kats:
* put up patches for an intermittent failure in APZ tests (legitimate bug) - bug 1213095
* put up patches for APZ checkerboarding telemetry - bug 1238040
* put up patches for APZ axis-locking on fennec - bug 1226655



botond:
  - reviews: bug 1238040 (feedback)
  - continuing to investigate bug 1237905 (test_wheel_transactions intermittent) via pushing logging patches to Try
  - bug 1201894 (fixed background inside transform): problem is difference between how Layout and AsyncCompManager handle this interaction
          - talked to :mattwoodrow to understand the model used by Layout better
          - discovered Layout's model isn't spec-compliant!
          - the parallax alternative needs the current (non-compliant) behaviour; will talk to :mstange about possibility of trying to change spec
  - bug 1240202 (a remaining homescreen stuck in stretched state issue), can't repro, but working with reporter (QA) to get some useful logging
  - MozReview: started looking at bug 1231397 (allowing auto-publish without prompt)
  - light refactoring patch to split APZ gtests into several files (bug 1240244)



edwin:
* Looking at intermittent 1229250 (apz scrollbar test on Fennec)
* Faffing around with mach and fennec and grrrrrr
* Looking into a crash happening when running reftests on Fennec



jnicol:
* wikipedia layerisation
* another site where we have multiple layers which are the full size of the page
* because somewhere in the middle of the display list there a single item which needs to go on a separate layer, everyhing below it gets one layer and above it gets another
