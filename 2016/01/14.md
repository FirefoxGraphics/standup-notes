Bas:
* lingering reference count - add ons?
* highest related crash, #36, Nvidia only, lots of them, mismatched vendor info (forcing Nvidia on Optimus, maybe older configs only?)



nical:
* Workstealing improvements
* try pushes with the cairo-image backend on linux
* only breaks one wp test, the rest is just fuzzing



lee
* getting Skia PushLayer stuff tested and ready to review
* landed fix for Skia fuzzer crash
* investigating Skia GPU clipping issue



kats:
* landed stuff, it got backed out. will debug and reland today
* e10s people seem to want to enable apz on the 45 beta experiment, discussing with them what the best option is



edwin (ro - london space meeting):
* spent most of today looking at a couple of potential offices, playing Spot the Hipster with the london folks. much sarcasm ensued and we learned that "broga" (yoga for bros, obviously) is a thing.
* 1239005 - super trivial scaling thing, but requires figuring out compositor-ey stuff.



jrmuizel
* webgl2 tests (fought rr a litle)
* reviews



jnicol (ro)
* viewed potential new offices. as well as broga, the guy also used the word "cray" without even a hint of irony
* setting up new workstation \o/
* 1223144 (non-pot texture scaling for single tile layers) uplifted to aurora but not beta
