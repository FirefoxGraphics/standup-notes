Nical:
* trying to reproduce the shmem issue, no luck so far. A bit worried that the fix gets us in a situation where we don't crash but don't render either
* still poking at shutdown stuff, trying to get a repro locally no luck either
* landed some fixes here and there
* reviews



BenWa:
* d3d9 perf patch review fixed, in auto-land queue, failed, XP Test don't actually run with --all, looks like the Map() count is unbalanced, I have an idea
* Looked into intermittent bmp decoder bug with Jeff
* Recorded some useful RR lessons here: https://benoitgirard.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/using-recordreplay-to-investigate-intermittent-oranges/
* Rewrote how RR commands are handled, merged



edwin
* 1229250 - chaos mode patch is up, finally.
* 1239005 - webgl scaling - patch mostly works. fine for large-ish canvases (< 100000px wide); anything more than that and it works when the canvas is its own layer, but disappears after the layer is flattened.



lee
* landing fixes for linear gradients in skia
* worked on upstreaming fix for copying of opaque bitmaps in skia (breaks non-alpha/opaque canvas)
* worked with Sotaro on fixing our android builds not enabling arm neon support in skia
* investigated bmp loading performance issue
