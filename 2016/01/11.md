* Now that media shutdown is in a better shape, giving another go at the ImageBridge and CompositorChild shutdown leaks
* causes some timeouts on windows, not sure why
* Looking at various crashes in OMTC land, making a patch for one of them
* Question: what's the deal with 3d transformed masks (and the BasicCompositor which seems to be the only compositor to not handle them)?



Bas:
* some regressions from push/pop
* comand list related issues
* push and end draw and clips and flush



edwin (afternoon pto):
* Patch for 1207958 - turned out to be a bug in how we handle oddly-sized .ico images with multiple BMPs.

botond:
  - requested aurora uplift for border-radius rendering regression (bug 1232939)
          - after discussing with :mstange weighing the risks, decided not to request beta uplift; I could be convinced otherwise
  - reviews: bug 1193055, bug 1226826, bug 1233056, bug 1229752 (in progress, need to play around with it to understand it properly)

* been testing it on beta and aurora too, works fine, will request uplift

BenWa:
* Bisecting winclang issues. Successfully bisected an issue with mixing clang/cl files. Caused by clang putting something as const and cl not.



jrmuizel:
* winclang bisecting stuff
* reviews/something that I haven't remembered yet
