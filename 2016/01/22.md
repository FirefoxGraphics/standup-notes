botond:
  - reviews: bug 1238042, bug 1231517
  - bug 1240202 (a remaining homescreen-stuck-in-stretched state issue)
          - examined logs provided by QA; through code inspection, came up with a couple of theories of what's causing the problem
          - wrote patches + tests for these issues
  - tried Matt's patches in bug 1231538 (building ContainerLayers for fixed-pos frames)
          - confirmed that they fix bug 1238571 (APZ fixed-pos issue)
          - attempted to test bug 1239943 as well, but the patches caused a crash on that test case :)
