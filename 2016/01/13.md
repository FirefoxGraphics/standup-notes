Bas:
* resize and lingering refcounts
* Intel driver crash



Nical
* looked at various intermittent failures
* closed some old bugs
* landed some stuff



jnicol
* understand framelayerbuilder a bit better
* layerisation issue i was looking at unfortunately seems unavoidable.
* looking at next site with fennec memory usage issues - wikipedia, not sure what's going on yet



kats:
* updated checkerboard recording patches to address review comments
* landed my fennec fixes, a couple of which got backed out for assertion failures :(
* started looking at an intermittent failure
* poked around with trying to enable APZ on mulet



botond:
  - border-radius rendering regression was uplifted to aurora
  - reviews: bug 1233182, bug 1229752 (also debugged on Fennec, tested on FxOS), bug 1227224 (tree traversal; also gave Kevin design guidance)
  - bug 990972 (subframe zooming): wrote up a description of an issue we'll run into (foreshadowed by bug 1229752)
  - investigating bug 1238571 (APZ bug involving position:fixed)
          - in the process, discovered an issue where we're painting too much; filed bug 1238805, investigating



lee
* Skia PushLayer, the saga continues - widget/gtk bugs



Jeff G:
* reviews
* sampler objects needs to be finished, catch up with WebGL2
* multisampling active
* with ANGLE on MT - they will estimate for their timeframes, deferred  rendering vs. device per share group (we need later), but could be not enough for others that would need deferred rendering
* Sean may do a prototype for our proposal, looks like it has legs



mchang
* skia talos regressions
* found a bug with skia content switching between CG/Skia backends
* skia reftest failures



jrmuizel
* Some PushLayer stuff with Skia
* WebGL2 tests
* Looked at GL reftests orange. It's caused by an intermittent shutdown timeout. However we don't get much information about why it's timing out.



sotaro
* Implementing TV Stream rendering(bug 1049296): Implementation completed waiting for a review
* Implementing screenshot via adb on gonk(bug 1238876, bug 1006688): Basic implementation completed
* Looking into TV board
* Reviews and feedbacks to media bugs



Peter, Morris, Ethan, Jerry
* WebGL2, testing, 
* OMT painting - content with problems
* starting looking at the orange intermittents as well - there may very well be a lot of them that are not real anymore



edwin:
* landed 1199923
* tried to reproduce 1238551; looks like the wrong test case.
* poking at bug 1180561 - win7 startup crash



BenWa:
* Worked with jeff to reduce the winclang issue to diagnose the graphics issue
* Looked into the d3d9 perf issue with e10s but we don't support unwinding on win64, looking into why.
