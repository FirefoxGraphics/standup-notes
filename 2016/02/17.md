* landed 1246443 (fix perf regression from subframe displayport size fix)
* requested checkin for 1247336 (don't treat as animation and therefore layerise when setting property to existing value)
* still trying to find cause of 1247098 (displayport too small now on some subframes). think i've narrowed it to which function is going wrong



Nical
* some progress on the texture recycling stuff



lee
* fixed building skia on openbsd
* trying to fix building skia on freebsd, but we have pre-existing issues with building clang plugin against libstdc++ that are now haunting us
* fixed shmem size assertion issue
* osx skiagl canvas issues



kats:
* fixed an intermittent gtest failure
* made progress on the code to disable apz on a per-page basis, seems to be working but needs more testing
* trying to track down more intermittently failing mochitests
* did an interview
* small stuff: updated profile for bug 1247979, backed out patch for bug 1246676 now that the checkerboarding regression is fixed, tried/failed to repro bug 1245925

* Bug 1223198
* It's possible that glib's slice allocation implementation is hiding potential misuses of slice-allocated memory from ASAN
* If so, the intermittent failures on ASAN are more than likely caused by uses of ASAN-poisoned memory regions
* Setting G_SLICE=always-malloc for ASAN tests should uncover any issues with misuse of glib slices
* Try run pending with always-malloc, hopefully we'll get additional information on potential slice misuses
* Looking into leaks revealed by G_SLICE=always-malloc
* https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=54c1954fd6a0
* libcanberra will likely need to be whitelisted for ASAN
