lee
* bug triage
* spent too much time investigating tscrollx regression, found and fixed several basic compositor clearing issues in the process... improved all tests locally, but could not find cause for regression on try, so just going to leave it as WONTFIX
* investigated android bug caused by ipdl shmem changes, managed to find fix (confirmed by Sotaro)
* investigated more ipdl file exhaustion issues that ultimately seem to happen because the amount of file descriptors we are simultaneously trading for shmems still exceeds the FD limit
