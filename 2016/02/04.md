* good progress on the shared allocator stuff



kats (not feeling well, pto today)
* landed patches to expire displayport, bug 990916. they seem to have caused an intermittent failure so i'll look into that (bug 1245830)
* landed bug 1236046 to fix bad velocity computations (usually at the start of scrolling), should help reduce checkerboarding
* continued re-triaging bugs with QA assistance. went through a whole pile of them, found one correctness blocker, bug 1104356 which i'll try to fix ASAP

* finishing up miscellaneous bugs



jnicol (at meeting about new london office)
* some reftest failures on backface-hidden stuff (1241078). easy to see the problem but not sure if reftests are wrong or my patch is wrong
