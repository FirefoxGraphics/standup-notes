* Bug 1245811 - Work on fixing fontconfig <prefer> and <alias> directives
* Currently, we only respect full font substitutions from fontconfig, not supporting the effects of all match directives
* Changing gfxPlatformFontList::FindFamily to return a list of font families seems like the simplest solution for now
* Draft patch correcting font usage via gfxTextRun
* Reviews for Karl
* Tried rr chaos mode and sadly could not reproduce GTK3 ASAN intermittents
* Not too surprising in hindsight considering we're only supposed to access GTK/glib from one thread



edwin
* review/feedback requests out the wazoo
* *still* looking at 925645
* still messing around with fix for 1180561



lee

kats:
* wrote a telemetry experiment to find how low we can make the displayport and what the impact is on checkerboarding. waiting for some more feedback before pushing it out.
* looking through telemetry APIs to figure out how to extract useful data
* APZ testing stuff
