Nical
* various shmurf stuff



edwin
* webgl windows crashing bugs 1209956 and 1227548 (cause looks similar)
* Can't repro, but maybe GLContext destruction weirdness from looking at the crash data -- GLContext subclasses' destructors zero out our function table, but occasionally GLContext still has resources lying around that need gl functions.

* patch for the missed presents from other threads



jrmuizel
* reviews and interviews

jnicol
* reworked patch for 1241078 (backface-hidden layerisation)
* writing patch to make TextureClientPool track free instead of total tiles to see what effect that has (1244148)
* bisecting fennec regression with fullscreen video and dynamic toolbar



kats:
* updated one of the apz telemetry probes
* doing some bug cleanup after QA's "re-triage" of apz-desktop bugs

* trying to help jim with the plugin hiding issues, bug 1243413



lee
* investigating pdf.js bug report about possible intermittent, but haven't been able to make sense of the test-case yet or reduce it to something workable
* discussions with Mike Reed about API changes we need to support PushLayer/PopLayer in Skia
* investigating Skia caching behavior with Jeff to make sure we understand why some surfaces were marked as cached/uncached



mchang
* learning about subpixel text positioning with skia
* trying to reproduce an android reftest failure
