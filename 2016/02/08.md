Bas:
* landed some bug fixes, including a crash in Aurora and a Windows workaround; no complaints yet, will consider uplifting
* scaled down layer reuses a texture, but a transparent layer+some complications leaves us with old content

* dealing with various regressions/bugs that have cropped up - bug 1246449, bug 1235899, bug 1245925
* landed the smooth scrolling on overflow:hidden fix, bug 1104356. requested uplift for that
