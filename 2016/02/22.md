* Wrote patch for bug 1249604, fixing drag and drop on old GTK versions
* Still looking into what could be causing GTK3 to intermittently render with a different engine on ASAN for bug 1223198.



Bas:
* sync present may have been causing blue screen on try servers, have another patch in review
* crash avoidance patch now gives incorrect rendering?
* dancing squares and textures with D3D12



Nical:
* a patch to make BasicComposior sample directly from BufferTextureHost's memory (removes a copy)
* progress on the texturesource recycling business
* Hey, canvasclient is super racy! (maybe?)
* b2g deadlock when gralloc is disabled
* looked at linux crash on treeherder, something is breaking around deserializing a message with a missing file descriptor



lee
* investigating report about regressed compositing performance without xrender, looked at a profile that showed we spent around 15% of compositing time just buffering the XShm surface, so wrote a fix to eliminate that for XShm path
* finding a bunch of other related silliness in our XShm path such as constant reallocating the XShm surface



edwin
* landed 1246984 - blackberry scrolling thing
* patch up for 1180561 - windows stackwalking crash
* prodded at hit list - made a thing to stitch it together with socorro data (at least for "unassigned graphics crashes" search) http://people.mozilla.org/~eflores/hitlist/




jnicol
* my patch to reduce backface-hidden layerization also fixed a bug, so backporting that to aurora
* investigating the most complex layerization i've ever seen



mchang
* found out how Chrome renders UI font on OS X
* looked at a perma-crash on Windows. Seems like device creation failing on child but not parent due to security sandbox



kats:
* made a test for touch-based tapping, required writing a bunch of touch event synthesization code, all on bug 1249915
* e10s cross-functional meeting, some followup to make sure things are good with QA on APZ. Also some discussion about telemetry probes



BenWa:
* Landed a patch for add support for RR non explicit checkpoint
