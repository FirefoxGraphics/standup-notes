Nical:
* Lot of triage    
* emails with media folks trying to figure out some texture sharing business
* some progress on the shmurf allocator thing (uint tests included)
* we have a bug with maps rendered with mapquest, cairo only, how far are we from skia canvas on linux? <--- let's flip the pref in 48.



Bas:
* workaround patch for the presentation bug, a few build issues (includes)
* performance and surfacebook



Edwin
* Finally got to the bottom of 1239005. Looks like cairo doesn't like compositing surfaces larger than 16 bits. Will just put up the patch I have now for feedback, but I guess hold out until Skia is everywhere (hi Lee :) )
* Comments on bug 1229250 (chaos mode badness and sadness)
* Doing some hardware archaeology to find a Win7 64 laptop for bugs 1209956, 1227548, and 1180561
* Navigated the minefield that is British bureaucracy so I can pay tax real proper like already



jnicol (read only, on a train)
* investigating more fennec oom reports
* trying to measure effect of changing textureclientpool size



jrmuizel
* reviews
* dxva investigation on G41 (it will not work there without heroics)



kats:
* landed and then backed out bug 1242690 (it caused regressions)
* turned on touch support on windows nightly (APZ and DOM touch events)
* turned on checkerboard recording by default on nightly, will be soliciting high-severity recordings
* did some investigation on bug 1243413 for jimm (plugins disappearing while scrolling)
* landed fix for bug 1231554 (galaxy note 8/10 dynamic toolbar issue), requested uplift
* some triaging of older bugs

          - test environment stopped working; filed bug 1244354, re-creating it
  - bug 1237905 (test_wheel_transactions intermittent) - landed some logging to be able to understand failures in automation

lee
* fighting with C++11 and Skia, but came up with a "solution"
* investigating performance regression for OSX + Skia canvas



mchang
