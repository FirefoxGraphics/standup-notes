kvark:
* some WR reviews and merges
* WR shader fixes with some glslangValidator help
* more WebGL bugs triage
* looking into the tex-image-webgl failure (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325731)
* investigating the spec and fixing cube-incomplete-fbo failure (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325685)
* playing patch ping-poing on the renderbuffer deletion (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1237748)




kats:
* spent a lot of time doing builds on windows. getting closer to a touch-dragging solution
* marked a bunch more reftests as passing on QR (they got magically fixed somewhere along the way). down to 221 failures now
