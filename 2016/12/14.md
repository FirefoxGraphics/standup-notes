* bug 1126091 (intermittent webcam test failures) -- rewrote the test as a mochitest as I think multipart images don't lend themselves well to reftests
* bug 1319025 (optimized apngs get misrendered) -- finally landed
* looking into how images work with webrender today



rhunt

* telemetry backend issues with GPU process probe; raised with telemetry team and should be fixed by now. waiting for data to come in.
* think I've found a possible cause for the printing issue with the GPU process; currently investigating how DWrite works to find out why it's broken
* looking to start ramping up on another area of quantum rendering as GPU process work should be spinning down in the next few weeks
