* Found that NVIDIA driver 361.42 avoids the talos GLX hang
* Hang on the talos slaves affects much more than firefox- quickly closing any GLX program can cause a hang in compiz
* Likely not viable to work around it in gecko, nor occur in the wild
* Submitted a patch to upgrade the drivers ( https://bugzil.la/1273286 ), should land soon
* Un-bitrotted GLX vsync patches
* Looking into firefox tour issues on GTK3 ( https://bugzil.la/1225044 )
