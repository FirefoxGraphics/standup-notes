nical:
* working on copy-on-write canvas
* first version works mostly, avoids copying textures whenever possible (in some FillRect or ClearRect cases)
* getting a snapshot is a bit tricky (working on that currently).
* currently allocates a new texture every frame (TODO)
* turns out we flatten inactive canvases but still share them with the compositor which is a bit wasteful with e10s.



Bas:
* shutdown bug; child crashing patch worked - SharedThreadPool is leaked, media code



jnicol
* 1269206 (black screen flash when restoring fennec)
* don't think this is gfx issue, it looks like we are forcing a composite as soon as we can after getting a surface to composite into (which is the correct behaviour). something else is causing a delay before that happens though.



edwin (ro)
* reset stuff
* 1272277 - patches up for review - resets causing us to go into total bizarro invalidate everything mode
* 1270428 - patch up for review - shared handles living too long around device resets
* 1245747 - webgl/angle crash after reset - had a patch but have a better way to do it; looking now



ashughes
* triaged crash explosiveness and top crash reports, filed https://bugzil.la/1272120,1272123,1272131




acomminos
* Continued hacking at talos hang
* Hang narrowed down to occur when setting the GLX context to None
* Appears to be timing related- the shutdown of the vsync thread occurs fine done immediately after instantiation
* Have a slave, going to focus efforts on reproducing for now



mchang
* triage
* subpixel AA text



lee
* working on presentation with Mason
* thebes fonts



kats:

* landed the audi scrolling fix, bug 1270955
