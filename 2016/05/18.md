Bas:
* shutdown issues; on release no crashes since the 12th?  unclear if we're getting any actual crash reports
* e10s and media tests
* reviews and ni's



nical:
* The texture locking stuff that landed as part of the war against shutdown bugs makes TSan unhappy
* talked with jseward for a while and working on a patch to mitigate some of the alerts
* fixed bugs with the copy-on-write canvas stuff, continuing
* landed a patch that should make the chrome respect the gtk dark themes without affecting web content but it caused some reftest failures and got backed out
* wondering if the test and reference run in different processes (one in a parent process and one in a child process), which could explain the difference



edwin
* triage
* getting distracted by triage bugs
* currently looking at why drop-shadow should be so slow on mobile
