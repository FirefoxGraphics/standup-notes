acomminos
* Managed to get talos hang to reproduce on a loaner!
* Can be reproduced by disabling x11vnc and running any talos suite immediately after a reboot.
* Subsequent runs don't exhibit the hang.
* Compiz and firefox both busy waiting @ 100% CPU in libGL- scary!
* Work on caching CSS node trees for GTK 3.20



jnicol
* 1269206 (black screen when restoring fennec) - because the app doesn't stop quickly enough when minimising. checking whether that's gfx's fault
* more layerization investigation



edwin
* landed some device reset stuff
* re-re-re-re-visiting 1245747 -- webgl/angle reset silliness

botond:
  - reviews: bug 1267928
  - requested aurora uplift for bug 1268009 (page not repainted with APZ disabled)
  - closed bug 1247454/1247456 (fancier telemetry for scroll input methods) as WONTFIX for now; doesn't seem worth the effort
  - bug 1272525 (regression from clip rect changes) - wrote attempted fix, trying to get it to not break tests
  - bit more work on bug 1272165 (reducing #ifdefs in APZC)
