Nical:
* Spent some time reviewing sotaro's texture recycling work
* fixed some issues with copy-on-write canvas, try run looks pretty good
* except the static analysis build which doesn't seem to want to let me AddRef/Release something manually, not sure what I am supposed to do about this.
* Wrote a patch making it possible to use the copy-on-write locks with any compositable (a remaining TODO for it to work with ImageBridge, almost there)
* Adding the copy-on-write lock optimization to canvas
