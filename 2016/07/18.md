Nical:
* Canvas progress
* the glitches I was still able to reproduce on canvas animations come from the canvas allocaion strategy not agreeing with our layerization
* disabling rendering into a texture when "! IsCompositingCheap" fixes the issue
* text rendering issues. very odd, not sure what is up with that, timing related, making progress. looks like there is some invalidation issue.



acomminos
* Investigating issues where Xlib may erroneously read for errors that should be handled by nsShmImage via XCB
* Likely depends on using the compositor X display for nsShmImage (patch wip)
* Looking into managing fullscreen events better on X11
* Resize after onfullscreenchange is making something racy when in a multicore environment- window.inner{Width,Height} has changed without reflow of contents using e10s
* GTK theming reviews (cont)



aosmond
* bug 1267379 - posted WIP patch which should fix the bug as described, but real problem is that there are a number of state variables that all need to be updated atomically rather than individually over time; working on new patch to solve that
* continuing to read imagelib code and discussions with seth



kats:
* landed code to control touch events per-tab, bug 970346
* caught my device in the bad state in bug 1274597, trying to figure out what's going on.

* finished the heap-buffer-overflow fix, just waiting on Bas to review

edwin
* kinda wondering whether anything in particular sparked the big warning up the top there.
* 1245747 - patch up.
* 1274624 - looking at why a certain fast path isn't being hit.
* 1272123 - looking at why chrome doesn't haemorrhage memory on repeated CanvasRenderingContext2D.save() calls like we do.
