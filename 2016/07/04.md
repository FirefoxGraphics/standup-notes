* Still can't get this stupid mochitest to run on device. Tried same network and everything.
* I've added some dumping to the mochitests to dump the base64 encoded screenshots in case of a failure. Will file a bug and land this, and I think it's needed.
* Going to shelve trying to get mochitests running on device until snorp is back from PTO (presumably tomorrow), so that I can find out what on earth is going on
* Been doing some paperwork post-MozLondon
