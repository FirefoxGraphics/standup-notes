acomminos
* Wrote a patch to make tab drag handling more consistent across {display,CSS} scales
* Wrote crash testing program for testing texture from pixmap failures using some X compositors



Bas:
* intermittents
* linear gradients and extra line



ernest
* warp fallback on angle failure at init, need to fix some suggestions



jnicol
* 1164027 (adreno oom)
* looks like old driver version (< lollipop) segfaults when glTexImage2D's mmap fails.
* proposed idea is to see if we can check if there's enough contiguous address space available before calling



edwin
* landed 1264505. should get rid of at least a quarter of our known gfx android crashes \o/
* more code review last night
* looked a little more at 1274624. patch seems to work afaict, just running reftests and need to fix whatever invariably fails, and to de-fuglify



nical:
* more float -> int conversion stuff
* looked at some crashes
* a shutdown one, maybe related to recycling video frames
* a thing in cairo that Bas suggested might be caused by cairo multitthreading woes, which is terrifying.
* How hard would it be to use skia with BasicCompositor?
* yet another ipdl deserialization crash, when deserializing a PTexture actor handle.
* fairly high volume on central, not sure what caused it or what actually happens apart from Read(PTextureParent*) returning false
* wondering if it has something to do with PTexture moving under PCompositor
* tomorrow is a holiday in france



lee
* Qt removal
* fontconfig



sotaro
* Update libyuv(bug 1284803): Got review+, about to check in.
* Video buffer recycling(bug 1254011, bug 1286130)
* Canvas video rendering problem when SkiaGL is used(bug 1250914)



jrmuizel
* reviews



Jeff G:
* WebGL2 stuff in reviews
* doing well with WebGL2 bugs



Peter
* Update WebGL conformance suite



Ethan
* WebGL
* reviews



Jerry
* work on driver reset(bug1285152)



Morris
* Webgl2 vector-dynamic-index testing fail
* FIx Mac regression(bug1284440)



Vincent
* Canvas fixes(1281800,1283113)



David:
* bootstrapping in place for COOP (compositor out of process)
* need gfxPlatform splitting into separate classes



gw280
* Was feeling nauseous yesterday so took a sick day
* Did a bunch of measurements with TextureClientPool, found another issue where we are discarding the pool very often (it seems on tab switches?). Filed a bug and wrote a patch to resolve that
* Autophone/mochitests are now working, so I can finally investigate the mochitest-skia failures on nexus 6p.





BenWa:
* Tested our blacklisting code with and without my patch. The basics appear ok
* Looked at swiftshader with jeff, wrote a patch to enable it



aosmond
* continue piecing together architecture notes on imagelib to understand context of current changes and future improvements before seth leaves



kats:
* continued fiddling with the overflow problems in bug 1283826. have a patch that seems to work now
* looked into bug 1286179, regression with restoring scroll position when APZ is enabled
* looking into web-platform-tests for touch-action and how to run them (ideally in automation)
