nical:
* canvas stuff
* looked at various crashes, needinfos, revies, etc.



ashughes
* developing plan to have Betabreakers vet Firefox 48 (Beta) against the upcoming Windows 10 Anniversary update (due the same day we release 48)
* Softvision has also been instructed to add it to the sign-off criteria for Fx48



Bas:
* using AVX bug



jnicol
* looking at over-layerisation caused by animated transforms



acomminos
* Looking into talos regressions caused by XCB SHM switch
* Most scrolling related regressions were un-regressed by using a separate X display for the compositor
* We may not have a block-aligned stride, however, which may fix the remaining basic_compositor_video regression
* Wrote patch for this
* Wrote patch to only use GL scissor test in GL compositor for bounded clears and clipping quads
* Talos changes seem to be negligible on OS X (good so we can perform unbounded clears on all platforms)
* Can likely land and remove manual 
* Talked with Markus, initial plan for fixing border-collapse



ernest
* land dxva to gfxconfig (feature: HW_VIDEO_DECODING)
* look into adding blacklist check after device creation 



edwin
* bug 1274624 - have a nice optimisation on the way for axis-aligned whole-pixel-size repeated linear gradients (will not attempt to pronounce this multiple times, or probably even once, in daily). was hoping to implement it earlier, but...
* more reviews and wtf'ing around recently-landed code to understand them.



mchang
* writing up webrender docs
* * 


jrmuizel
* reviews
* some exploration into rust's exceptions



kats:
* heap buffer thing got backed out again, updated the patch but it looks like it's causing unexpected-pass on some GL tests
* more touch-action patches/tests



aosmond
* continued looking into bug 1267379
* continued reading and discussions with seth (streaminglexer, surfacepipe, decoder this time)



lee
* finished up pixelsize handling with fontconfig in cairo font host, put up for reviews
* investigating possible crash with windows xp and avx
* reviews
